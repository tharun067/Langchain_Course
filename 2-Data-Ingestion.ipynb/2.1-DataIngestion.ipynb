We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.\\n\\nJust because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\\n\\n…\\n\\nIt will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck. We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us—however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts.\\n\\nWe have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship—exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible. We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women of German birth and native sympathy who live among us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test. They are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance. They will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose. If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few.\\n\\nIt is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress, which I have performed in thus addressing you. There are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us. It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming to be in the balance. But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts—for democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a universal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.\\n\\nTo such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who know that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her blood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and happiness and the peace which she has treasured.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < ndoes not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions.

Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds.

We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Introduction\\nA ﬁber graph is a graph on the ﬁnitely many lattice points F ⊂Zd of a polytope where\\ntwo lattice points are connected by an edge if their diﬀerence lies in a ﬁnite set of allowed\\nmoves M ⊂Zd. The implicit structure of these graphs makes them a useful tool to explore\\nthe set of lattice points randomly: At the current lattice point u ∈F, an element m ∈±M\\nis sampled and the random walk moves along m if u + m ∈F and stays at u otherwise.\\nThe corresponding Markov chain is irreducible if the underlying ﬁber graph is connected and\\nthe set M is called a Markov basis for F in this case. This paper investigates the heat-bath\\nversion of this random walk: At the current lattice point u ∈F, we sample m ∈M and move\\nto a random element in the integer ray (u + Z · m) ∩F. The authors of [6] discovered that\\nthis random walk can be seen as a discrete version of the hit-and-run algorithm [15, 26, 16]\\nthat has been used frequently to sample from all the points of a polytope – not only from its\\nlattice points. The popularity of the continuous version of the hit-and-run algorithm has not\\nspread to its discrete analog, and not much is known about its mixing behaviour. One reason\\nis that it is already challenging to guarantee that all points in the underlying set F can be\\nDate: September 12, 2018.\\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classiﬁcation.

However, in many situations where a Markov\\nbasis is known, the heat-bath random walk is evidently fast. For instance, it was shown in [3]\\nthat the heat-bath random walk on contingency tables mixes rapidly when the number of\\ncolumns is ﬁxed. To work around the connectedness issue, a discrete hit-and-run algorithm\\nwas introduced in [1] for arbitrary ﬁnite sets F ⊂Zd. At each step in this random walk, a\\nsubordinate and unrestricted random walk starts at the current lattice point u ∈F and uses\\nthe unit vectors to collect a set of proposals S ⊂Zd. The random walk then moves from u\\nto a random point in S ∩F.\\nRandom walks of the heat-bath type, such as the one presented above, have been studied\\nrecently in [8] in a more general context. In this paper, we explore the mixing behaviour of\\nheat-bath random walks on the lattice points of polytopes with Markov bases. Throughout,\\nwe assume that a Markov basis has been found already and refer to the relevant literature\\nfor their computation [24, 25, 11, 17, 10, 21]. We call the underlying graph of the heat-bath\\nrandom walk a compressed ﬁber graph (Deﬁnition 2.5) and determine in Section 3 bounds on\\nits graph-diameter. We prove that for any A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A)∩Nd = {0}, the diameter of\\ncompressed ﬁber graphs on {u ∈Nd : Au = b} that use a ﬁxed Markov bases M ⊂kerZ(A) is\\nbounded from above by a constant as b varies (Theorem 3.15). In contrast, we show that the\\ndiameter of conventional ﬁber graphs grow linearly under a dilation of the underlying polytope\\n(Remark 3.9). This gives rise to slow mixing results for conventional ﬁber walks as observed\\nin [27]. In Section 4, we study in more detail the combinatorial and analytical structure\\nof the transition matrices of heat-bath random walks on lattice points and prove upper and\\nlower bounds on their second largest eigenvalues. We also discuss how the distribution on the\\nmoves M aﬀects the speed of convergence (Example 4.21). Theorem 5.8 establishes with the\\ncanonical path approach from [23] an upper bound on the second largest eigenvalue when the\\nMarkov basis is augmenting (Deﬁnition 5.1) and the stationary distribution is uniform. From\\nthat, we conclude fast mixing results for random walks on lattice points in ﬁxed dimension.\\nAcknowledgements.

The natural numbers are N := {0, 1, 2, . . .} and for any N ∈N,\\nN>N := {n ∈N : n > N} and N≥N := {N} ∪N>N. For n ∈N>0, let [n] := {1, . . . , n}. Let\\nM ⊂Qd be a ﬁnite set, then Z·M := {λm : m ∈M, λ ∈Z} and NM is the aﬃne semigroup\\nin Zd generated by M.

A graph is always undirected and can have multiple loops.\\nThe distance of two nodes u, v which are contained in the same connected component of a\\ngraph G, i.e. the number of edges in a shortest path between u and v in G, is denoted by\\ndistG(u, v). We set distG(u, v) := ∞if u and v are disconnected. A mass function on a ﬁnite\\nset Ωis a map f : Ω→[0, 1] such that P\\nω∈Ωf(ω) = 1. A mass function f on Ωis positive\\nif f(ω) > 0 for all ω ∈Ω. A set F ⊂Zd is normal if it there exists a polytope P ⊂Qd such\\nthat P ∩Zd = F.\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n3\\n2. Graphs and statistics\\nWe ﬁrst introduce the statistical framework in which this paper lives and recall important\\naspects of the interplay between graphs and statistics. A random walk on a graph G = (V, E)\\nis a map H : V × V →[0, 1] such that for all v ∈V , P\\nu∈V H(v, u) = 1 and such that\\nH(v, u) = 0 if {v, u} ̸∈E. When there is no ambiguity, we represent a random walk as an\\n|V | × |V |-matrix, for example when it is clear how the elements of V are ordered. Fix a\\nrandom walk H on G. Then H is irreducible if for all v, u ∈V there exists t ∈N such that\\nHt(v, u) > 0. The random walk H is reversible if there exists a mass function µ : V →[0, 1]\\nsuch that µ(u) · H(u, v) = µ(v) · H(v, u) for all u, v ∈V and symmetric if H is a symmetric\\nmap. A mass function π : V →[0, 1] is a stationary distribution of H if π ◦H = π. For\\nsymmetric random walks, the uniform distribution on V is always a stationary distribution.\\nIf |V | = n, then we denote the eigenvalues of H by 1 = λ1(H) ≥λ2(H) ≥· · · ≥λn(H) ≥−1\\nand we write λ(H) := max{λ2(H), −λn(H)} for the second largest eigenvalue modulus of H.\\nAny irreducible random walk has a unique stationary distribution [14, Corollary 1.17] and\\nλ(H) ∈[0, 1] measures the convergence rate: the smaller λ(H), the faster the convergence.\\nThe aim of this paper is to study random walks on lattice points that use a set of moves.\\nTypically, this is achieved by constructing a graph on the set of lattice points as follows\\n(compare to [7, Section 1.3] and [24, Chapter 5]).\\nDeﬁnition 2.1. Let F ⊂Zd be a ﬁnite set and M ⊂Zd. The graph F(M) is the graph on\\nF where two nodes u, v ∈F are adjacent if u −v ∈M or v −u ∈M.\\nA normal set F ⊂Zd is ﬁnite and satisﬁes F = convQ(F)∩Zd. A canonical class of normal\\nsets that arise in many applications, is given by the ﬁbers of an integer matrix:\\nDeﬁnition 2.2. Let A ∈Zm×d and b ∈NA. The set FA,b := {u ∈Nd : Au = b} is the b-ﬁber\\nof A. The collection of all ﬁbers of A is PA := {FA,b : b ∈NA}. For M ⊂kerZ(A), the graph\\nFA,b (M) is a ﬁber graph.\\nLet F, M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite. If the membership in F can be veriﬁed eﬃciently – for instance\\nwhen F is given implicitly by linear equations and inequalities – then it is possible to explore\\nF randomly using M as follows: At a given node v ∈F, a uniform element m ∈M is\\nselected. If v + m ∈M, then the random walk moves along m to v + m and if v + m ̸∈M,\\nthe we stay at v. Formally, we obtain the following random walk.\\nDeﬁnition 2.3. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be two ﬁnite sets. The simple walk is the random\\nwalk on F(M) where the probability to traverse between to adjacent nodes u and v is |±M|−1\\nand the probability to stay at a node u is |{m ∈±M : u + m ̸∈F}| · | ± M|−1.\\nThe simple walk is symmetric and hence the uniform distribution is a stationary distribu-\\ntion (see also [27, Section 2]). To ensure convergence, the random walk has to be irreducible,\\nthat is, the underlying graph has to be connected. The following deﬁnition is a slight adaption\\nof the generalized Markov basis as deﬁned in [21, Deﬁnition 1].\\nDeﬁnition 2.4. Let P be a collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd. A ﬁnite set M ⊂Zd is a\\nMarkov basis of P, if for all F ∈P, F(M) is a connected graph.\\n4\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nWe refer to [6, Theorem 3.1] for a proof that for collections PA, a ﬁnite Markov basis\\nalways exists and can be computed with tools from commutative algebra (see also [11] for\\nmore on the computation of Markov bases). We now introduce a construction of graphs on\\nlattice points that also give rise to implementable random walks, but whose edges have far\\nmore reach.\\nDeﬁnition 2.5. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets. The compression of the graph\\nF(M) is the graph Fc(M) := F(Z · M).\\nFigure 1. Compressing graphs.\\nCompressing a graph F(M) preserves its connectedness: F(M) is connected if and only\\nif Fc(M) is connected.\\n3. Bounds on the diameter\\nIn general knowledge of the diameter of the graph underlying a Markov chain can provide\\ninformation about the mixing time. For random walks on ﬁber graphs, the chains which we\\nconsider, the underlying graph coincides with the ﬁber graph. In this section, we determine\\nlower and upper bounds on the diameter of ﬁber graphs and their compressed counterparts.\\nFor a ﬁnite set M ⊂Zd and any norm ∥· ∥on Rd, let ∥M∥:= maxm∈M ∥m∥.\\nLemma 3.1. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets, then\\ndiam(F(M)) ≥\\n1\\n∥M∥· max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈F}.\\nProof. If F(M) is not connected, then the statement holds trivially, so assume that M is a\\nMarkov basis for F. Let u′, v′ ∈F such that ∥u′ −v′∥= max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈F} and let\\nm1, . . . , mr ∈M so that u′ = v′+Pr\\ni=1 mi is a path of minimal length, then ∥u′−v′∥≤r·∥M∥\\nand the claim follows from diam(F(M)) ≥distF(M)(u′, v′) = r.\\n□\\nRemark 3.2. Let F ⊂Zd be a normal set. For all l ∈{−1, 0, 1}d and u, v ∈F we have\\n(u −v)T l ≤∥u −v∥1 and thus widthl(F) := max{(u −v)T l : u, v ∈F} ≤max{∥u −v∥1 :\\nu, v ∈F}. Suppose that u′, v′ ∈F are such that ∥u′ −v′∥1 = max{∥u −v∥1 : u, v ∈F} and\\nlet l′\\ni := sign(u′\\ni −v′\\ni) for i ∈[d], then\\n∥u′ −v′∥1 = (u′ −v′)T · l′ ≤widthl′(F) ≤max{∥u −v∥1 : u, v ∈F} = ∥u′ −v′∥1.\\nThe lattice width of F is width(F) := minl∈Zd widthl(F) and thus Lemma 3.1 gives\\n∥M∥1 · diam(F(M)) ≥width(F).\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n5\\nDeﬁnition 3.3. Let P be a collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd.\\nA ﬁnite set M ⊂Zd is\\nnorm-like for P if there exists a constant C ∈N such that for all F ∈P and all u, v ∈F,\\ndistF(M)(u, v) ≤C · ∥u −v∥. The set M is ∥· ∥-norm-reducing for P if for all F ∈P and all\\nu, v ∈F there exists m ∈M such that u + m ∈F and ∥u + m −v∥< ∥u −v∥.\\nThe property of being norm-like does not depend on the norm, whereas being norm-\\nreducing does.\\nNorm-reducing sets are always norm-like, and norm-like sets are in turn\\nalways Markov bases, but the reverse of both statements is false in general (Example 3.4 and\\nExample 3.5). For collections PA however, every Markov basis is norm-like (Proposition 3.7).\\nExample 3.4. For any n ∈N, consider the normal set Fn := ([2]×[n]×{0})∪{(2, n, 1)} with\\nthe Markov basis {(0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1), (−1, 0, −1)}. The distance between (1, 1, 0) and (2, 1, 0)\\nin Fn(M) is 2n and thus M is not norm-like for {Fn : n ∈N} (see also Figure 2).\\nExample 3.5. Let d ∈N and consider A := (1, . . . , 1) ∈Z1×d, then the set M := {e1 −ei :\\n2 ≤i ≤d} is a Markov basis for the collection PA. However, M is not ∥·∥p-norm-reducing for\\nany d ≥3 and any p ∈[1, ∞]. For instance, consider e2 and e3 in FA,1 (M). The only move\\nfrom M that can be applied on e2 is e1−e2, but ∥(e2+e1−e2)−e3)∥p = ∥e2−e3∥p. On the other\\nhand, in the case we cannot ﬁnd a move that decreases the 1-norm of two nodes u, v ∈FA,b\\nby 1, we can ﬁnd instead two moves m1, m2 ∈M such that u + m1, u + m1 + m2 ∈FA,b and\\n∥u + m1 + m2 −v∥= ∥u −v∥−2. Thus, the graph-distance of any two elements u and v in\\nFA,b (M) is at most ∥u −v∥1 and hence M is norm-like for PA.\\nFigure 2. The graph from Example 3.4\\nRemark 3.6. Let P be a collection of ﬁnite subsets of Zd and M ⊂Zd be norm-like for P.\\nIt follows from the deﬁnition that there exists a constant C ∈Q≥0 such that for all F ∈P\\ndiam(F(M)) ≤C · max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈F}.\\nThe proof of our next results uses the Graver basis GA ⊂Zd for an integer matrix A ∈Zm×d\\nwith kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0}. We refer to [4, Chapter 3] for a precise deﬁnition.\\nProposition 3.7. Let A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and M ⊂kerZ(A) be a Markov\\nbasis of PA. Then M is norm-like for PA.\\nProof. Let M be a Markov basis for PA. The Graver basis GA for A is a ﬁnite set which\\nis ∥· ∥1-norm-reducing for PA. Thus, deﬁne C := maxg∈GA diam(FA,Ag+ (M)). Now, pick\\nu, v ∈FA,b arbitrarily and let u = v + Pr\\ni=1 gi be a walk from u to v in FA,b (GA) of minimal\\nlength. Since the Graver basis is norm-reducing for FA,b, there always exists a path of length\\nat most ∥u −v∥1 and hence r ≤∥u −v∥1. Every gi can be replaced by a path in FA,Ag+\\ni (M)\\n6\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nof length at most C and these paths stay in FA,b. This gives a path of length C · r, hence\\ndistFA,b(M)(u, v) ≤C∥u −v∥1.\\n□\\nProposition 3.8. Let P ⊂Zd be a polytope with dim(P ∩Zd) > 0 and let M be a Markov\\nbasis for Fi := (i · P) ∩Zd for all i ∈N. There exists a constant C′ ∈Q>0 such that for all\\ni ∈N, C′ · i ≤diam(Fi(M)). If M is norm-like for {Fi : i ∈N}, then there exists a constant\\nC ∈Q>0 such that diam(Fi(M)) ≤C · i for all i ∈N.\\nProof. For the lower bound on the diameter, it suﬃces to show the existence of C′ such that\\nC′ · i ≤max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈Fi} for all i ∈N due to Lemma 3.1. Since dim(P ∩Zd) > 0,\\nwe can pick distinct w, w′ ∈P ∩Zd. For all i ∈N, i · w, i · w′ ∈Fi and hence i · ∥w −w′∥≤\\nmax{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈Fi}.\\nTo show the upper bound, assume that M is norm-like. It suﬃces to show that there\\nexists C ∈Q≥0 such that max{∥u −v∥: u, v ∈Fi} ≤i · C by Remark 3.6.\\nNow, let\\nv1, . . . , vr ∈Qd such that P = convQ(v1, . . . , vr) and deﬁne C := max{∥vs −vt∥: s ̸= t}.\\nSince Fi = (i·P)∩Zd ⊂convQ(iv1, . . . , ivr) for all i ∈N, we have max{∥u−v∥: u, v ∈Fi} ≤\\nmax{∥ivs −ivt∥: s ̸= t} ≤C · i.\\n□\\nRemark 3.9. Let A ∈Zm×n with kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and let M be a Markov basis for PA.\\nThen M is norm-like due to Proposition 3.7 and thus for all b ∈NA there exists C, C′ ∈Q≥0\\nsuch that\\ni · C′ ≤diam(FA,ib (M)) ≤i · C\\nfor all i ∈N. This generalizes for instance [20, Proposition 2.10] and [27, Example 4.7], where\\nlinear diameters on a ray in NA have been observed. This also implies that the construction\\nof expanders from [27, Section 4] works for every right-hand side b ∈NA.\\nRemark 3.10. Let A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A)∩Nd = {0}, b ∈NA, and let M be a Markov basis\\nfor PA. Proposition 3.8 provides a new proof that the simple walk on (FA,ib (M))i∈N cannot\\nmix rapidly. The lower bound on the diameter from Proposition 3.8 implies, in general, the\\nfollowing upper bound on the edge-expansion (see for example [9, Proposition 1.30]):\\nh(FA,i·b (M)) ≤|M|\\n\\x12\\nexp\\n\\x12log |FA,i·b|\\nD · i\\n\\x13\\n−1\\n\\x13\\n.\\nIn particular, the edge-expansion cannot be bounded from below by Ω( 1\\np(i))i∈N for a polyno-\\nmial p ∈Q[t] and since (|FA,i·b|)i∈N ∈O(ir)i∈N, the simple walk cannot mix rapidly. In [27],\\nit was shown that the edge-expansion can be bounded from above by O(1\\ni )i∈N, which cannot\\nbe concluded from the upper expression.\\nWe now turn our attention to the diameter of compressed ﬁber graphs.\\nIn particular,\\nwe want to know for which collections of normal sets is their diameter bounded. In general,\\ncompressing a ﬁber graph does not necessarily have an eﬀect on the diameter (Example 3.11).\\nAlthough a low diameter is a necessary condition for good mixing, it is not suﬃcient.

Heat-bath random walks\\nIn this section, we establish the heat-bath random walk on compressed ﬁber graphs. We\\nrefer to [8] for a more general introduction on random walks of heat-bath type. Let F ⊂Zd\\nbe ﬁnite set. For any u ∈F and m ∈Zd, the ray in F through u along m is denoted by\\nRF,m(u) := (u + m · Z) ∩F. Additionally, given a mass function π : F →[0, 1], we deﬁne\\nHπ\\nF,m(x, y) :=\\n(\\nπ(y)\\nπ(RF,m(x))\\n, if y ∈RF,m(x)\\n0\\n, otherwise\\nfor x, y ∈F. For M ⊂Zd and a mass function f : M →[0, 1], the heat-bath random walk is\\n(4.1)\\nHπ,f\\nF,M =\\nX\\nm∈M\\nf(m) · Hπ\\nF,m.\\nThe underlying graph of the heat-bath random walk is the compression Fc(M) and in this\\nsection, we assume throughout that for all m ∈M and λ ∈Z \\\\ {−1, 1}, λ · m ̸∈M. Let us\\nﬁrst recall the basic properties of this random walk (compare also to [6, Lemma 2.2]).\\nAlgorithm 1 Heat-bath random walk on compressed ﬁber graphs\\nInput: F ⊂Zd, M ⊂Zd, v ∈F, mass functions f : M →[0, 1] and π : F →[0, 1], r ∈N\\n1: procedure HeatBath:\\n2:\\nv0 := v\\n3:\\nFOR s = 0; s = s + 1, s < r\\n4:\\nSample m ∈M according to f\\n5:\\nSample vs+1 ∈RF,m(vs) according to RF,m(vs) →[0, 1], y 7→\\nπ(y)\\nπ(RF,m(vs))\\n6:\\nRETURN v1, . . . , vr\\nProposition 4.1. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets. Let f : M →[0, 1] and π : F →\\n(0, 1) be mass functions. Then Hπ,f\\nF,M is aperiodic, has stationary distribution π, is reversible\\nwith respect to π, and all of its eigenvalues are non-negative. The random walk is irreducible\\nif and only if {m ∈M : f(m) > 0} is a Markov basis for F.\\nProof. Since for any u ∈F and any m ∈M, Hπ\\nF,m(u, u) > 0, there are halting states and\\nthus Hπ,f\\nF,M is aperiodic. By deﬁnition, π(x)Hπ\\nF,m(x, y) = π(y)Hπ\\nF,m(y, x) and thus Hπ,f\\nF,M\\nis reversible with respect to π and π is a stationary distribution.\\nThe statement on the\\neigenvalues is exactly [8, Lemma 1.2]. Let M′ = {m ∈M : f(m) > 0} and f ′ = f|M′, then\\nHπ,f\\nF,M = Hπ,f′\\nF,M′ and thus the heat-bath random walk is irreducible if and only if M′ is a\\nMarkov basis for F.\\n□\\nRemark 4.2. Analyzing the speed of convergence of random walks with second largest\\neigenvalues does not take the computation time of a single transition into account. From\\na computational point of view, the diﬀerence of the simple walk and the heat-bath random\\nwalk is Step 4 of Algorithm 1. However, we argue that Step 4 can be done eﬃciently in\\nmany cases. For instance, a hard normalizing constant of π cancels out. If π is the uniform\\ndistribution, then one needs to sample uniformly from RF,m(v) in Step 4, which can be done\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n9\\neﬃciently. If the input of Algorithm 1 is a normal set F = {u ∈Zd : Au ≤b} that is given\\nin H-representation, then the length of the ray RF,m(v) can be computed with a number of\\nrounding, division, and comparing operations that is linear in the number of rows of A.\\nThere are situations in which the heat-bath random walk provides no speed-up compared\\nwith the simple walk (Example 4.3). Intuitively, adding more moves to the set of allowed\\nmoves should improve the mixing time of the random walk. In general, however, this is not\\ntrue for the heat-bath walk (Example 4.4).\\nExample 4.3. For n ∈N, consider the normal set\\nFn :=\\n\\x1a\\x14\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n· · ·\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n· · ·\\n0\\n\\x15\\n,\\n\\x14\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n· · ·\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n· · ·\\n0\\n\\x15\\n, . . . ,\\n\\x14\\n1\\n1\\n· · ·\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n· · ·\\n0\\n1\\n\\x15\\x1b\\n⊂Q2×n.\\nIn the language of [7, Section 1.1], Fn is precisely the ﬁber of the 2 × n independence model\\nwhere row sums are (n −1, 1) and column sums are (1, 1, . . . , 1).\\nThe minimal Markov\\nbasis of the independence model, often referred to as the basic moves, is precisely the set\\nMn := {v −u : u, v ∈Fn} \\\\ {0}. In particular, the ﬁber graph Fn(Mn) is the complete\\ngraph on n nodes. All rays along basic moves have length 2 and thus the transition matrices\\nof the simple random walk and the heat-bath random walk coincide. There are n · (n −1)\\nmany basic moves and the transition matrix of both random walks is\\n1\\nn(n −1)\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8ef\\uf8f0\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n...\\n...\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fa\\uf8fb+ (n(n −1) −n)\\nn(n −1)\\n· In.\\nThe second largest eigenvalue is 1 −\\n1\\nn−1 which implies that for n →∞, neither the simple\\nwalk nor the heat-bath random walk are rapidly mixing.\\nExample 4.4. Let F = [2] × [5] ⊂Z2, M = {e1, e2, 2e1 + e2}, and let π be the uniform\\ndistribution on F.\\nSince {e2, 2e1 + e2} is not a Markov basis for F, any mass function\\nf : M →[0, 1] must have f(e1) > 0 in order to make the corresponding heat-bath random\\nwalk irreducible.\\nComparing the second largest eigenvalue modulus of heat-bath random\\nwalks that sample from {e1, e2} and M uniformly, we obtain\\nλ\\n\\x121\\n2Hπ\\nF,e1 + 1\\n2Hπ\\nF,e2\\n\\x13\\n= 1\\n2 < 2\\n3 = λ\\n\\x121\\n3Hπ\\nF,e1 + 1\\n3Hπ\\nF,e2 + 1\\n3Hπ\\nF,2e1+e2\\n\\x13\\n.\\nSo, adding 2e1 + e2 to the set of allowed moves slows the walk down. This phenomenon does\\nnot appear for the simple walk on F, where the second largest eigenvalue modulus improves\\nfrom ≈0.905 to ≈0.888 when adding the move 2e1 + e2 to the Markov basis.\\n=\\n+\\n+\\nFigure 3.

If the moves are selected uniformly, then the heat-bath random walk on\\nF coincides with the Glauber dynamics on F. To see it, choose u ∈F and let\\nF′ := {λ ∈Zd : u + λ1m1 + · · · + λdmd ∈F}.\\nIt is easy to check that F′ is unique up to translation and depends only on F, u, and M.\\nSince the vectors in M are linearly independent, every element of F can be represented by\\na unique choice of coeﬃcients in F′. Thus, the heat-bath random walk on F using M is\\nequivalent to the heat-bath random walk on on F′ using the unit vectors as moves. For any\\nunit vector ei ∈Zd, the ray through an element v ∈F′ is {w ∈F : wj = vj∀j ̸= i} and this\\nis precisely the form desired in the Glauber dynamics [14, Section 3.3.2].\\nFor the remainder of this section, we primarily focus on heat-bath random walks Hπ,f\\nF,M\\nthat converge to the uniform distribution π on a ﬁnite, but not necessarily normal, set\\nF. We particularly aim for bounds on its second largest eigenvalue by making use of the\\ndecomposition from equation 4.1. Our ﬁrst observations consider its summands Hπ\\nF,m that\\ncan be well understood analytically (Proposition 4.6) and combinatorially (Proposition 4.7).\\nProposition 4.6. Let F ⊂Zd be a ﬁnite set, m ∈Zd, and π : F →[0, 1] be the uniform\\ndistribution. Let R1, . . . , Rk be the disjoint rays through F along m. Then\\n1.

The spectrum of Hπ\\nF,m is {0, 1}.\\nProof. Symmetry of Hπ\\nF,m follows from the deﬁnition. By assumption, F is the disjoint union\\nof R1, . . . , Rk and hence there exists a permutation matrix S such that SHπ\\nF,mST is a block\\nmatrix whose building blocks are the matrices\\n1\\n|Ri|\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8ef\\uf8f0\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n...\\n...\\n1\\n. . .\\n1\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fa\\uf8fb∈Q|Ri|×|Ri|.\\nThus, Hπ\\nF,m is idempotent and the rank of Hπ\\nF,m is k.

It is clear by Proposition 4.6 that the set on the right-hand side is contained in any\\nimg(Hπ\\nF,m) since any Vi decomposes disjointly into rays along m ∈M. To show the other\\ninclusion, write M = {m1, . . . , mk} and let for any i ∈[k], Ri\\n1, . . . , Ri\\nni be the disjoint rays\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n11\\nthrough F parallel to mi. In particular, {Ri\\n1, . . . , Ri\\nni} is a partition of F for any i ∈[k]. Let\\nv ∈T\\nm∈M img(Hπ\\nF,m).

We show that for any i ∈[k] and any a ∈[c], λi\\nj = λi\\nj′\\nwhen Ri\\nj and Ri\\nj′ are a subset of Va. This implies the proposition. So take distinct x, x′ ∈Va\\nand assume that x and x′ lie on diﬀerent rays of mi and let that be x ∈Ri\\nj and x′ ∈Ri\\nj′ with\\nj ̸= j′. Since x and x′ are in the same connected component Va of F(M), let yi0, . . . , yir ∈F\\nbe the nodes on a minimal path in Fc(M) with yi0 = x and yir = x′. For any s ∈[r], yis\\nand yis−1 are contained in the same ray Rks\\nts coming from a Markov move mks.

Let\\nV1, . . . , Vc be the connected components of F(M′), πi : Vi →[0, 1] the uniform distribution,\\nand f ′ = (1 −f(m))−1 · f|M′, then\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≤f(m) + (1 −f(m)) · max{λ(Hπi,f′\\nVi,M′) : i ∈[c]}.\\nProof. Let H := Hπ,f′\\nF,M′ be the heat-bath random walk on F(M) that samples moves from M′\\naccording to f ′, then Hπ,f\\nF,M = f(m)·Hπ\\nF,m +(1−f(m))·H. By assumption, all pairs (m, m′)\\nwith m′ ∈M′ have the intersecting ray property and thus the matrices Hπ\\nF,m and H commute\\naccording to Proposition 4.15. The eigenvalues of all involved matrices are non-negative and\\nthus Lemma 4.16 implies that the second largest eigenvalue of Hπ,f\\nF,M has the form λ + λ′\\nwhere λ ∈{0, f(m)} by Proposition 4.6 and where λ′ is an eigenvalue of (1 −f(m)) · H.

It is easy to verify that Fc(M) has the intersecting ray property and thus Proposi-\\ntion 4.18 shows λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≤1−min(f). Assume that min(f) = f(ei). The connected compo-\\nnents of Fc({e1, . . . , ed} \\\\ {ei}) are the layers Vj := {u ∈F : ui = j} for any j ∈[ni] and the\\nrays through F parallel are Rk := {(0, k)+s·ei : s ∈[ni]} for k = (k1, . . . , ki−1, ki+1, . . . , kd) ∈\\n[n1] × · · · × [ni−1] × [ni+1] × · · · × [nd]. In particular, any ray intersects any connected com-\\nponent exactly once.\\nThus, the matrix (|Rk ∩Vj|)k,j is the all-ones matrix, which has a\\nnon-trivial kernel. Proposition 4.12 implies λ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≥1 −f(ei).\\n□\\nRemark 4.20. In the special case n := n1 = · · · = nd and f : {e1, . . . , ed} →[0, 1] the\\nuniform distribution in Proposition 4.19, the heat-bath random walk on [n]d is known as\\nRook’s walk in the literature. In this case, Proposition 4.19 is exactly [13, Proposition 2.3].\\nIn [18], upper bounds on the mixing time of the Rook’s walk were obtained with path-coupling.\\nThe stationary distribution of the heat-bath random walk is independent of the actual\\nmass function on the Markov moves. The problem of ﬁnding the mass function which leads\\n14\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nto the fastest mixing behaviour can be formulated as the following optimization problem:\\n(4.2)\\narg min\\n(\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) : f : M →(0, 1),\\nX\\nm∈M\\nf(m) = 1\\n)\\n.\\nIt follows from Proposition 4.19 that the optimal value of (4.2) for F = [n1] × · · · × [nd],\\nM = {e1, . . . , ed}, and the uniform distribution π on F is the uniform distribution on M.\\nAnother example where the uniform distribution is the optimal solution to (4.2), but where\\nthe veriﬁcation is more involved, is presented in Example 4.21.\\nExample 4.21. Let F = [2] × [5] as in Example 4.4 and consider M = {e1, 2e1 + e2}. We\\ninvestigate for which µ ∈(0, 1), the transition matrix µHπ\\nF,e1 + (1 −µ)Hπ\\nF,2e1+e2 has the\\nsmallest second largest eigenvalue modulus. Its characteristic polynomial in Q[µ, x] is\\n−1\\n25x4(x −1)(µ + x −1)6(−5x2 + 5x + 2µ2 −2µ)(−5x2 + 5x + 4µ2 −4µ)\\nand hence its eigenvalues are\\nx1(µ) := 1,\\nx2(µ) := 1 −µ,\\nx3(µ) := 1\\n2\\n\"\\n1 +\\nr\\n1 + 8\\n5(µ2 −µ)\\n#\\n,\\nx4(µ) := 1\\n2\\n\"\\n1 −\\nr\\n1 + 8\\n5(µ2 −µ)\\n#\\n,\\nx5(µ) := 1\\n2\\nh\\n1 +\\np\\n1 + 4(µ2 −µ)\\ni\\n,\\nx6(µ) := 1\\n2\\nh\\n1 −\\np\\n1 + 4(µ2 −µ)\\ni\\n.\\nIt is straightforward to check that x5(µ) > 1\\n2 > x6(µ), x3(µ) > 1\\n2 > x4(µ). Since µ2 −µ < 0\\nfor u ∈(0, 1) and x3(µ) ≥x6(µ). We can show that x4(µ) ≥x2(µ) and thus\\nλ(µHπ\\nF,e1 + (1 −µ)Hπ\\nF,2e1+e2) = 1\\n2\\n\"\\n1 +\\nr\\n1 + 8\\n5(µ2 −µ)\\n#\\n.\\nThe fastest heat-bath random walk on F(M) which converges to uniform is thus obtained for\\nµ = 1\\n2, i.e. when the moves are selected uniformly. The second largest eigenvalue in this case\\nis\\n1\\n10(5 +\\n√\\n15) ≈0.887, which is larger than the second largest eigenvalue of the heat-bath\\nwalk that selects uniformly from {e1, e2} (see Proposition 4.19).\\n5. Augmenting Markov bases\\nIt follows from our investigation in Section 3 that the diameter of all compressed ﬁber\\ngraphs coming from a ﬁxed integer matrix A ∈Zm×d can be bounded from above by a\\nconstant. However, Markov moves can be used twice in a minimal path which can make the\\ndiameter of the compressed ﬁber graph larger than the size of the Markov basis. The next\\ndeﬁnition puts more constraints on the Markov basis and postulates the existence of a path\\nthat uses every move from the Markov basis at most once.\\nDeﬁnition 5.1. Let F ⊂Zd be a ﬁnite set and M = {m1, . . . , mk} ⊂Zd. An augmenting\\npath between distinct u, v ∈F of length r ∈N is a path in Fc(M) of the form\\nu →u + λi1mi1 →u + λi1mi1 + λi2mi2 →· · · →u +\\nr\\nX\\nk=1\\nλikmik = v\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n15\\nwith distinct indices i1, . . . , ir ∈[k]. An augmenting path is minimal for u, v ∈F if there\\nexists no shorter augmenting path between u and v in Fc(M).\\nA Markov basis M for\\nF is augmenting if there is an augmenting path between any distinct nodes in F.\\nThe\\naugmentation length AM(F) of an augmenting Markov basis M is the maximum length of\\nall minimal augmenting paths in Fc(M).\\nNot every Markov basis is augmenting (see Example 3.11), but the diameter of compressed\\nﬁber graphs that use an augmenting Markov basis is at most the number of the moves. For\\nﬁber graphs coming from an integer matrix, an augmenting Markov basis for all of its ﬁbers\\ncan be computed (Remark 5.2).\\nRemark 5.2. Let A ∈Zm×d with kerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and let b ∈NA. The Graver basis\\nis an augmenting Markov basis for FA,b for any b ∈NA. We claim that when A is totally\\nunimodular, then AGA(FA,b) ≤d2(rank(A) + 1).\\nIn particular, the augmentation length\\nis independent of the right-hand side b.\\nLet u, v ∈FA,b be arbitrary and for i ∈N, let\\nli := min{ui, vi}, wi := max{ui, vi}, and ci := sign(ui −vi) ∈{−1, 0, 1}. Then v is the unique\\noptimal value of the linear integer optimization problem\\nmin{cT x : Ax = b, l ≤x ≤w, x ∈Zd}.\\nA discrete steepest decent as deﬁned in [5, Deﬁnition 3] using Graver moves needs at most\\n∥c∥1 · d · (rank(A) + 1) ≤d2 · (rank(A) + 1) many augmentations from u to reach the optimal\\nvalue v. We refer to [5, Corollary 8] which ensures that every Graver move is used at most\\nonce. Note that in [5], x is constrained to x ≥0 instead to x ≥l, but their argument works\\nfor any lower bound.\\nExample 5.3. Fix d ∈N and consider A and M from Example 3.5. We show that M is an\\naugmenting Markov basis for FA,b for any b ∈N. Let u, v ∈FA,b be distinct, then there exists\\ni ∈[d] such that ui > vi or ui < vi, thus, we can walk from u to u′ := u + (ui −vi)(e1 −ei)\\nor from v to v′ := v + (vi −ui)(e1 −ei). In any case, after that augmentation, the pairs\\n(u′, v) and (v′, u) coincide in the ith coordinate and thus we ﬁnd an augmenting path by\\ninduction on the dimension d. We have used at most d −1 many edges in these paths and\\nhence AM(FA,b) ≤d −1 for all b ∈N.\\nWe now show that the augmentation length is essentially bounded from below by the\\ndimension of the node set and hence the bound observed in Example 5.3 cannot be improved.\\nWe ﬁrst need the following lemma.\\nLemma 5.4. Let v1, . . . , vk ∈Qd such that any v ∈spanQ {v1, . . . , vk} can be represented by\\na linear combination of r vectors. Then dim(spanQ {v1, . . . , vk}) ≤r.\\nProof. Let B ⊂P(v1, . . . , vk) the set of all subsets of cardinality r. By our assumption,\\n∪B∈BspanQ {B} = spanQ {v1, . . . , vk}. Since dim(spanQ {B}) ≤r for all B ∈B and since B\\nis ﬁnite, the claim follows.\\n□\\nProposition 5.5. Let P ⊂Qd be polytope and let M ⊂Zd be an augmenting Markov basis\\nfor Fi := (i · P) ∩Zd for all i ∈N. Then dim(P) ≤maxi∈N AM(Fi).\\n16\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nProof. Without restricting generality, we can assume that 0 ∈P. Let V := spanQ {P} be\\nthe Q-span of P, then dim(P) = dim(V ). We must have dim(spanQ {M}) = dim(V ) since\\ndim(P) = dim(convQ(Fi)) for i suﬃciently large and since M is a Markov basis for Fi. Deﬁne\\nr := maxi∈N AM(Fi) and choose any non-zero v ∈V and u ∈relint(P) ⊂Qd. Then there\\nexists δ ∈Q>0 such that u + δv ∈P. Thus, 1\\nδu + v ∈1\\nδP. Let c ∈N≥1 such that i := c\\nδ ∈N\\nand w := c\\nδu ∈Zd. Then w + cv = c(1\\nδ u + v) ∈(i · P) ∩Zd = Fi. By assumption, there exists\\nan augmenting path from w to w + cv using only r elements from M. Put diﬀerently, the\\nelement cv from V can be represented by a linear combination of r vectors from M. Since v\\nwas chosen arbitrarily, Lemma 5.4 implies dim(P) = dim(V ) ≤r.\\n□\\nRemark 5.6. It is a consequence from Proposition 5.5 that for any matrix A ∈Zm×d with\\nkerZ(A) ∩Nd = {0} and an augmenting Markov basis M, there exists F ∈PA such that\\nAM(F) ≥dim(kerZ(A)).\\nLet us now shortly recall the framework from [23] which is necessary to prove our main\\ntheorem. Let G = (V, E) be a graph. For any ordered pair of distinct nodes (x, y) ∈V × V ,\\nlet px,y ⊆E be a path from x to y in G and let Γ := {px,y : (x, y) ∈V × V, x ̸= y} be\\nthe collection of these paths, then Γ is a set of canonical paths. Let for any edge e ∈E,\\nΓe := {p ∈Γ : e ∈p} be the set of paths from Γ that use e. Now, let H : V × V →[0, 1] be a\\nsymmetric random walk on G and deﬁne\\nρ(Γ, H) := max{|p| : p ∈Γ}\\n|V |\\n· max\\n{u,v}∈E\\n|Γ{u,v}|\\nH(u, v).\\nObserve that symmetry of H is needed to make ρ(Γ, H) well-deﬁned. This can be used to\\nprove the following upper bound on the second largest eigenvalue.\\nLemma 5.7. Let G be a graph, H be a symmetric random walk on G, and Γ be a set of\\ncanonical paths in G. Then λ2(H) ≤1 −\\n1\\nρ(Γ,H).\\nProof. The stationary distribution of H is the uniform distribution and thus the statement\\nis a direct consequence of [23, Theorem 5], since ρ(Γ, H) is an upper bound on the constant\\ndeﬁned in [23, equation 4].\\n□\\nTheorem 5.8. Let F ⊂Zd be ﬁnite and let M := {m1, . . . , mk} ⊂Zd be an augmenting\\nMarkov basis. Let π be the uniform and f be a positive distribution on F and M respectively.\\nFor i ∈[k], let ri := max{|RF,mi(u)| : u ∈F} and suppose that r1 ≥r2 ≥· · · ≥rk.

Choose for any distinct u, v ∈F an augmenting path pu,v of minimal length in Fc(M)\\nand let Γ be the collection of all these paths. Let u + µmk = v be an edge in Fc(M), then\\nour goal is to bound |Γ{u,v}| from above. Let S := {S ⊆[r] : |S| ≤AM(F), k ∈S} and take\\nany path px,y ∈Γ{u,v}. Then there exists S := {i1, . . . , is} with s := |S| ≤AM(F) such that\\nx + Ps\\nk=1 λikmik = y. Since px,y uses the edge {u, v}, there is j ∈[s] such that ij = k and\\nλij = µ.

Bounding |S| rigorously from above\\nby 2|M|, the claim follows from Lemma 5.7.\\n□\\nDeﬁnition 5.9. Let F ⊂Zd and M ⊂Zd be ﬁnite sets. The longest ray through F along\\nvectors of M is RF,M := arg max{|RF,m(u)| : m ∈M, u ∈F}.\\nCorollary 5.10. Let (Fi)i∈N be a sequence of ﬁnite sets in Zd and let πi be the uniform\\ndistribution on Fi. Let M ⊂Zd be an augmenting Markov basis for Fi with AM(Fi) ≤\\ndim(Fi) and suppose that (|RFi,M|)dim(Fi))i∈N ∈O(|Fi|)i∈N.\\nThen for any positive mass\\nfunction f : M →[0, 1], there exists ǫ > 0 such that λ(Hπi,f\\nFi,M) ≤1 −ǫ for all i ∈N.\\nProof. This is a straightforward application of Theorem 5.8.\\n□\\nCorollary 5.11. Let P ⊂Zd be a polytope, Fi := (i · P) ∩Zd for i ∈N, and let πi be the\\nuniform distribution on Fi. Suppose that M ⊂Zd is an augmenting Markov basis {Fi : i ∈N}\\nsuch that AM(Fi) ≤dim(P) for all i ∈N. Then for any positive mass function f : M →[0, 1],\\nthere exists ǫ > 0 such that λ(Hπi,f\\nFi,M) ≤1 −ǫ for all i ∈N.\\nProof. Let r := dim(P). We ﬁrst show that (|RFi,M|)i∈N ∈O(i)i∈N. Write M = {m1, . . . , mk}\\nand denote by li := max{|(u + mi · Z) ∩P| : u ∈P} be the length of the longest ray through\\nthe polytope P along mi. It suﬃces to prove that i · (lk + 1) is an upper bound on the\\nlength of any ray along mk through Fi. For that, let u ∈Fi such that u + λmk ∈Fi for\\nsome λ ∈N, then 1\\ni u + λ\\ni mk ∈P and thus ⌊λ\\ni ⌋≤lk, which gives λ ≤i · (lk + 1). With\\nC := max{l1, . . . , lk} + 1 we have |RFi,M| ≤C · i. Ehrhart’s theorem [2, Theorem 3.23]\\ngives (|Fi|)i∈N ∈Ω(ir)i∈N and since |RFi,M| ≤C · i, we have (|RFi,M|r)i∈N ∈O(|Fi|)i∈N. An\\napplication of Corollary 5.10 proves the claim.\\n□\\nExample 5.12. Fix d, r ∈N and let Cd,r := {u ∈Zd : ∥u∥1 ≤r} be the set of integers of the\\nd-dimensional cross-polytope with radius r. The set Md = {e1, . . . , ed} is a Markov basis for\\nCd,r for any r ∈N. We show that Md is an augmenting Markov basis whose augmentation\\nlength is at most d. For that, let u, v ∈Cd,r distinct elements. We claim that there exists\\ni ∈[d] such that xi ̸= vi and ui + (vi −ui) ∈Cd,r. Let S ⊆[d] be the set of indices where u\\nand v diﬀer and let s = r −||u||1. If |S| = 1, then the result is clear so suppose |S| ≥2. If\\nthe result doesn’t hold then for all i ∈S, |vi| −|ui| > s. It follows that\\n∥v∥1 =\\nX\\ni/∈S\\n|ui| +\\nX\\ni∈S\\n|vi| >\\nX\\ni/∈S\\n|ui| +\\nX\\ni∈S\\ns + |ui| = |Suv| · s + ∥u∥1 = (|S| −1) · s + r.\\nBut we assumed that v ∈Cd,r. It follows that for any pair of points u, v in Cd,r, there is a\\nwalk, using the unit vectors as moves, that uses each move at most once. Corollary 5.10 yield\\nthat for any d ∈N, the second largest eigenvalue modulus of the heat-bath random walk on\\nCd,r with uniform as stationary distribution can be strictly bounded away from 1 for r →∞.\\n18\\nCAPRICE STANLEY AND TOBIAS WINDISCH\\nThe bound on the second largest eigenvalue in Theorem 5.8 is quite general and can be\\nimproved vastly, provided one has better control over the paths. For example, this can be\\nachieved for hyperrectangles intersected with a halfspace.\\nProposition 5.13. Let a ∈Nd\\n>0, b ∈N, F = {u ∈Nd : aT · u ≤b}, and M := {e1, . . . , ed}.\\nIf π and f are the uniform distributions on F and M respectively, then\\nλ(Hπ,f\\nF,M) ≤1 −|F|\\nd2\\nd\\nY\\ni=1\\nai\\nb .\\nProof. Observe that M is a Markov basis for F since all nodes are connected with 0 ∈F.\\nLet u, v ∈F be distinct. We ﬁrst show that there exists k ∈[d] such that uk ̸= vk and\\nu + (vk −uk)ek ∈F. If u ≤v, the statement trivially holds. Otherwise, there exists k ∈[d]\\nsuch that uk > vk and the vector obtained by replacing the kth coordinate of u by vk remains\\nin F. Now, consider for the following path between u and v: Choose the smallest index\\nk ∈[d] such that uk ̸= vk and such that u + (vk −uk) · ek ∈F and proceed recursively with\\nu + (vk −uk) and v. This gives a path pu,v between u and v of length at most d. Let Γ be\\nthe collection of all these paths. We want to apply Lemma 5.7. Thus, let x ∈F and consider\\nthe edge x →x + c · es. Let us count the paths pu,v that use that edge. Let u, v ∈F and let\\nk1, . . . , kr ∈[d] be distinct indices such that\\nu →u + (vk1 −uk1)ek1 →u + (vk1 −uk1)ek1 + (vk2 −uk2)ek2 →· · · →v\\nrepresents the path pu,v constructed by the upper rule.\\nAssume that pu,v uses the edge\\n{x, x + ces} and let kl = s and (vkl −ukl) = c. In particular,\\nu + (vk1 −uk1)ek1 + · · · + (vkl−1 −ukl−1)ekl−1 = x\\nx + (vkl −ukl)ekl + · · · + (vkr −ukr)ekr = v.\\nWe see that vkt = xkt for all t < l and that ukt = xkt for all t ≥l. In particular, vkl =\\nukl + c = xkl + c is also ﬁxed. The coordinates ukt and vkt are bounded from above by\\nb\\nakt\\nfor all t ∈[r], and hence there can be at most\\n l−1\\nY\\nt=1\\nb\\nakt\\n!\\n·\\n \\nr\\nY\\nt=l+1\\nb\\nakt\\n!\\n.\\nSince k1, . . . , kt are distinct coordinate indices, we have\\n|Γx,x+c·es|\\nHπ,f\\nF,M(x, x + c · es)\\n≤d ·\\nd\\nY\\ni=1\\nb\\nai\\n.\\nLemma 5.7 ﬁnishes the proof.\\n□\\nIn ﬁxed dimension, Proposition 5.13 leads to rapid mixing, but for d →∞, no statement\\ncan be made. In [19], it was shown that the simple walk with an additional halting probability\\non {u ∈Nd : atu ≤b} ∩{0, 1}d has mixing time in O(d4.5+ǫ). For zero-one polytopes, simple\\nand heat-bath walk coincide and we are conﬁdent that a similar statement holds without the\\nrestriction on zero-one polytopes.\\nHEAT-BATH RANDOM WALKS WITH MARKOV BASES\\n19\\nThe heat-bath random walk mixes rapidly when an augmenting Markov basis with a small\\naugmentation length is used.\\nWe think that it is interesting to question how might an\\naugmenting Markov bases be obtained and how their augmentation length can be improved.\\nQuestion 5.14. Let M be an augmenting Markov basis of A.

       "'Generative AI pornography or simply AI pornography is a digitally created pornography produced through generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. Unlike traditional pornography, which involves real actors and cameras, this content is synthesized entirely by AI algorithms. These algorithms, including Generative adversarial network (GANs) and text-to-image models, generate lifelike images, videos, or animations from textual descriptions or datasets.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\nThe use of generative AI in the adult industry began in the late 2010s, initially focusing on AI-generated art, music, and visual content. This trend accelerated in 2022 with Stability AI\\'s release of Stable Diffusion (SD), an open-source text-to-image model that enables users to generate images, including NSFW content, from text prompts using the LAION-Aesthetics subset of the LAION-5B dataset. Despite Stability AI\\'s warnings against sexual imagery, SD\\'s public release led to dedicated communities exploring both artistic and explicit content, sparking ethical debates over open-access AI and its use in adult media. By 2020, AI tools had advanced to generate highly realistic adult content, amplifying calls for regulation.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated influencers ===\\nOne application of generative AI technology is the creation of AI-generated influencers on platforms such as OnlyFans and Instagram. These AI personas interact with users in ways that can mimic real human engagement, offering an entirely synthetic but convincing experience. While popular among niche audiences, these virtual influencers have prompted discussions about authenticity, consent, and the blurring line between human and AI-generated content, especially in adult entertainment.\\n\\n\\n=== The growth of AI porn sites ===\\nBy 2023, websites dedicated to AI-generated adult content had gained traction, catering to audiences seeking customizable experiences. These platforms allow users to create or view AI-generated pornography tailored to their preferences. These platforms enable users to create or view AI-generated adult content appealing to different preferences through prompts and tags, customizing body type, facial features, and art styles. Tags further refine the output, creating niche and diverse content. Many sites feature extensive image libraries and continuous content feeds, combining personalization with discovery and enhancing user engagement. AI porn sites, therefore, attract those seeking unique or niche experiences, sparking debates on creativity and the ethical boundaries of AI in adult media.\\n\\n\\n=== Generative AI porn \"communities\" ===\\nPopular sites like civitai.com allow users to create, upload, and download fine-tuned versions of open source models of SDXL, Flux, and that are specifically designed for generating various pornographic scenes or effects.\\n\\n\\n== Ethical concerns and misuse ==\\nThe growth of generative AI pornography has also attracted some cause for criticism. AI technology can be exploited to create non-consensual pornographic material, posing risks similar to those seen with deepfake revenge porn and AI-generated NCII (Non-Consensual Intimate Image). A 2023 analysis found that 98% of deepfake videos online are pornographic, with 99% of the victims being women. Some famous celebrities victims of deepfake include Scarlett Johansson, Taylor Swift, and Maisie Williams.\\nOpenAI is exploring whether NSFW content, such as erotica, can be responsibly generated in age-appropriate contexts while maintaining its ban on deepfakes. This proposal has attracted criticism from child safety campaigners who argue it undermines OpenAI\\'s mission to develop \"safe and beneficial\" AI. Additionally, the Internet Watch Foundation has raised concerns about AI being used to generate sexual abuse content involving children.\\n\\n\\n=== AI-generated non-consensual intimate imagery (AI Undress) ===\\nGenerative AI have extensively been used to produce pornography images and videos of non-consenting individuals. 404 Me'"
