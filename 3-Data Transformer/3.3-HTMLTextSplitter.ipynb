    "##### How to split by HTML header\n",
    "HTMLHeaderTextSplitter is a \"structure-aware\" chunker that splits text at the HTML element level and adds metadata for each header \"relevant\" to any given chunk. It can return chunks element by element or combine elements with the same metadata, with the objectives of (a) keeping related text grouped (more or less) semantically and (b) preserving context-rich information encoded in document structures. It can be used with other text splitters as part of a chunking pipeline.\n"

On the basis of that\\nviewpoint he laid the foundation for the program of conceptual\\nanalysis within set theory (see below). He adhered to Hilbert’s\\n“original rationalistic conception” in mathematics (as he\\ncalled\\n it); and he was prophetic in anticipating and emphasizing the importance\\nof large cardinals in set theory before their importance became\\nclear.  \\n[ ]  \\n1  \\nEntry Contents Entry Contents  \\n1.

       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Kurt Gödel', 'Header 2': '1. Biographical Sketch'}, page_content='Kurt Gödel was born on April 28, 1906 in what was then the\\nAustro-Hungarian city of Brünn, and what is now Brno in the Czech\\nRepublic.  \\nGödel’s father Rudolf August was a businessman, and his\\nmother Marianne was a well-educated and cultured woman to whom\\nGödel remained close throughout his life, as witnessed by the\\nlong and wide-ranging correspondence between them. The family was well\\noff, and Gödel’s childhood was an uneventful one, with one\\nimportant exception; namely, from about the age of four Gödel\\nsuffered frequent episodes of poor health, and the health problems he\\nsuffered then as well as others of various kinds were to plague him\\nhis entire life.  \\nHealth problems notwithstanding, Gödel proved to be an exemplary\\nstudent at primary school and later the Gymnasium, excelling\\nespecially in mathematics, languages and religion. Upon his graduation\\nfrom the Gymnasium in Brno in 1924 Gödel enrolled in the\\nUniversity of Vienna, attending lectures on physics, his initial field\\nof interest, lectures on philosophy given by Heinrich Gomperz, and\\nlectures on mathematics. Gödel took a number of physics courses\\nduring his undergraduate years, as witnessed by his university\\ntranscript; this is notable in view of Gödel’s subsequent\\ncontributions to relativity in 1947. Philipp Furtwängler, cousin\\nof the great German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, was one of his\\nmathematics professors, and indeed Furtwängler’s course on\\nclass field theory almost tempted Gödel to pursue his studies in\\nthat area. Gödel learned his logic from Rudolph Carnap and from\\nHans Hahn, eventually graduating under Hahn with a Dr.phil. in\\nmathematics in 1929. The main theorem of his dissertation was the\\ncompleteness theorem for first order logic (Gödel\\n 1929).  \\n[ ]  \\n2  \\nGödel’s university years also marked the beginning of his\\nattendance at meetings of the Vienna Circle, a group around Moritz\\nSchlick that quickly became known as “logical\\npositivists,” a term coined by Feigl and Blumberg in their 1931\\n“Logical positivism: A new movement in European\\nphilosophy” (Feigl and Blumberg 1931). Though Gödel was not\\nhimself a logical positivist, those discussions were a crucial\\nformative influence.  \\nThe 1930s were a prodigious decade for Gödel. After publishing\\nhis 1929 dissertation in 1930, he published his groundbreaking\\nincompleteness theorems in 1931, on the basis of which he was granted\\nhis Habilitation in 1932 and a Privatdozentur at the University of\\nVienna in 1933.  \\nAmong his mathematical achievements at the decade’s close is the\\nproof of the consistency of both the Axiom of Choice and\\nCantor’s Continuum Hypothesis with the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms\\nfor set theory, obtained in 1935 and 1937, respectively. Gödel\\nalso published a number of significant papers on modal and\\nintuitionistic logic and arithmetic during this period, principal\\namong which is his “On intuitionistic arithmetic and number\\ntheory,” (Gödel 1933e), in which he showed that classical\\nfirst order arithmetic is interpretable in Heyting arithmetic by a\\nsimple translation. Other publications of the 1930s include those on\\nthe decision problem for the predicate calculus, on the length of\\nproofs, and on differential and projective geometry.  \\nBy the end of the decade both Gödel’s advisor Hans Hahn and\\nMoritz Schlick had died (the latter was assassinated by an\\nex-student), two events which led to a personal crisis for Gödel.\\nAlso, his appointment at the University, that of Privatdozentur, was\\ncancelled, being replaced by the position “Dozentur neuer\\nOrdnung,” granted to candidates only after they had passed a\\nracial\\n test. Gödel’s three trips the United States during that decade\\ntriggered an investigation. (See Sigmund 2006.) Finally, Gödel\\nwas found fit for military service by the Nazi government in 1939.  \\n[ ]  \\n3  \\nAll of these events were decisive in influencing his decision to leave\\nAustria in 1940, when he and his wife Adele emigrated to the United\\nStates. This long and difficult episode in their life is recounted by\\nJohn Dawson in his biography of Gödel called “Logical\\nDilemmas,” (Dawson 1997) as well as by Solomon Feferman in\\n“Gödel’s Life and Work,” (Feferman 1986) to\\nboth of which the reader is referred.  \\nUpon arrival Gödel took up an appointment as an ordinary member\\nat the Institute for Advanced Study; he would become a permanent\\nmember of the Institute in 1946 and would be granted his professorship\\nin 1953. (Gödel and his wife were granted American citizenship in\\nApril 1948.) He would remain at the Institute until his retirement in\\n1976. The Gödels never returned to Europe.  \\nGödel’s early years at the Institute were notable for his\\nclose friendship with his daily walking partner Albert Einstein, as\\nwell as for his turn to philosophy of mathematics, a field on which\\nGödel began to concentrate almost exclusively from about 1943.\\nThe initial period of his subsequent lifelong involvement with\\nphilosophy was a fruitful one (in terms of publications): in 1944 he\\npublished his first philosophical paper, entitled “On\\nRussell’s Mathematical Logic” (Gödel 1944), and in\\n1947 he published his second, entitled “What is Cantor’s\\nContinuum Hypothesis?” (Gödel 1947). In 1949 he published\\nhis third, entitled “A Remark on the Relationship between\\nRelativity Theory and Idealistic Philosophy.” (Gödel\\n1949a). The latter paper coincided with results on rotating universes\\nin relativity he had obtained in 1949, which were first published in\\nan article entitled: “An Example of a New Type of Cosmological\\nSolutions of Einstein’s Field Equations of Gravitation.”\\n(Gödel 1949).  \\nAmong Gödel’s other significant philosophical works of the\\n1940s must be counted his 1941 lecture entitled “In What Sense\\nis Intuitionistic Logic Constructive?” (Gödel *1941) in\\nwhich the notion: “computable function of finite type” is\\nintroduced. A paper based on the ideas in the lecture entitled\\n“Über eine bisher noch nicht benützte Erweiterung des\\nfiniten Standpunktes,” was published only in 1958, and the\\ninterpretation of Heyting arithmetic into the quantifier free calculus\\n\\\\(T\\\\) in it became known as the “Dialectica\\nInterpretation,” after the journal in which the article was\\npublished (Gödel 1958). (For the revision of it from 1972, see\\nGödel 1995.) Finally the decade saw the beginning of\\nGödel’s intensive study of Leibniz, which, Gödel\\nreports, occupied the period from 1943 to\\n 1946.  \\n[ ]  \\n4  \\nThe 1950s saw a deepening of Gödel’s involvement with\\nphilosophy: In 1951 Gödel delivered a philosophical lecture at\\nBrown University, usually referred to as the Gibbs Lecture, entitled\\n“Some Basic Theorems on the Foundations of Mathematics and Their\\nPhilosophical Implications” (Gödel *1951). From 1953 to\\n1959 Gödel worked on a submission to the Schilpp volume on Rudolf\\nCarnap entitled “Is Mathematics a Syntax of Language?”\\n(Gödel *1953/9-III, Gödel *1953/9-V). Gödel published\\nneither of these two important manuscripts in his lifetime, although\\nboth would appear on two lists which were found in the Gödel\\nNachlass, entitled “Was ich publizieren könnte.” (In\\nEnglish: “What I could publish.” Both manuscripts\\neventually appeared in Gödel 1995.) By the decade’s close\\nGödel developed a serious interest in\\n phenomenology.  \\n[ ]  \\n5  \\nGödel’s final years are notable for his circulation of two\\nmanuscripts: “Some considerations leading to the probable\\nconclusion that the true power of the continuum is\\n\\\\(\\\\aleph_2\\\\),” (Gödel *1970a, *1970b) his attempt\\nto derive the value of the continuum from the so-called scale axioms\\nof Hausdorff, and his “Ontologischer Beweis,” (Gödel\\n*1970) which he entrusted to Dana Scott in 1970 (though it appears to\\nhave been written earlier). Taken together, the two manuscripts are\\nthe fitting last words of someone who, in a fifty year involvement\\nwith mathematics and philosophy, pursued, or more precisely, for pursuing those two subjects under the\\nsingle heading: “strenge Wissenschaft”—a turn of\\nmind that had been in place from Gödel’s start in 1929,\\nwhen at the age of twenty-three he opened his doctoral thesis with\\nsome philosophical remarks.  \\nsought the grounds  \\nGödel died in Princeton on January 14, 1978 at the age of 71. His\\ndeath certificate records the cause of death as “starvation and\\ninanition, due to personality disorder.” His wife Adele survived\\nhim by three years.  \\nFor further biographical material, see Gödel 1987, Kleene 1987,\\nKreisel 1980, Taussky-Todd 1987 and Yourgrau 2005.'),\n",

An essential difference with earlier efforts\\n(discussed below and elsewhere, e.g. in Zach 1999), is that Gödel\\ndefines meticulously all the relevant basic concepts.  \\nA “logical expression” in Gödel’s terminology\\nis a well-formed first order formula without identity. An expression\\nis “refutable” if its negation is provable,\\n“valid” if it is true in every interpretation and\\n“satisfiable” if it is true in some interpretation. The\\nCompleteness Theorem is stated as follows:  \\nEvery valid logical expression is provable. Equivalently, every\\nlogical expression is either satisfiable or refutable.  \\nTheorem 1  \\nGödel’s proof calculus is that of Hilbert and\\nAckermann’s text. An expression is in normal form if all the\\nquantifiers occur at the beginning. The degree of an expression or\\nformula is the number of alternating blocks of quantifiers at the\\nbeginning of the formula, assumed to begin with universal quantifiers.\\nGödel shows that if the completeness theorem holds for formulas\\nof degree \\\\(k\\\\) it must hold for formulas of degree \\\\(k +\\n1\\\\). Thus the question of completeness reduces to formulas of degree 1.\\nThat is, it is to be shown that any normal formula \\\\((Q)\\\\phi\\\\)\\nof degree 1 is either satisfiable or refutable, where\\n“\\\\((Q)\\\\)” stands for a (non-empty) block of universal\\nquantifiers followed by a (possibly empty) block of existential\\nones.  \\nGödel defines a book-keeping device, a well-ordering of all\\ntuples of variables arising from a need to satisfy \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) as dictated\\nby \\\\((Q)\\\\). For example, if \\\\((Q)\\\\phi\\\\) is\\n\\\\(\\\\forall x_0\\\\exists x_1\\\\psi(x_0,\\nx_1)\\\\), we list the quantifier-free formulas\\n\\\\(\\\\psi(x_n, x_{n+1})\\\\). (Or more precisely, finite\\nconjunctions of these in increasing length. See below.) Then in any\\ndomain consisting of the values of the different\\n\\\\(x_n\\\\), in which each\\n\\\\(\\\\psi(x_n, x_{n+1})\\\\) is\\ntrue, the sentence \\\\((Q)\\\\phi\\\\) is clearly true. A crucial lemma\\nclaims the provability, for each \\\\(k\\\\), of the formula\\n\\\\((Q)\\\\phi \\\\rightarrow \\n(Q_k)\\\\phi_k\\\\), where the\\nquantifier free formula \\\\(\\\\phi_k\\\\) asserts the truth\\nof \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\) for all tuples up to the kth tuple of variables arising from\\n\\\\((Q)\\\\), and\\n\\\\((Q_k)\\\\phi_k\\\\) is the\\nexistential closure of \\\\(\\\\phi_k\\\\). (See the example\\nbelow where the definition of the \\\\(\\\\phi_{k'}\\\\)s\\nis given.) This lemma is the main step missing from the various\\nearlier attempts at the proof due to Löwenheim and Skolem, and,\\nin the context of the completeness theorem for first order logic,\\nrenders the connection between syntax and semantics completely\\nexplicit.  \\nLet us consider an example of how a particular formula would be found\\nto be either satisfiable or its negation provable, following\\nGödel’s method: Consider \\\\(\\\\phi = \\\\forall x_0\\\\exists x_1\\\\psi(x_0,\\nx_1)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\psi(x_0,\\nx_1)\\\\) is quantifier-free. We show that this is\\neither refutable or satisfiable. We make the following\\ndefinitions:  \\n\\\\(\\\\phi_0\\\\) is the expression \\\\(\\\\psi(x_0, x_1)\\\\).  \\n\\\\(\\\\phi_1\\\\) is the expression\\n\\\\(\\\\psi(x_0, x_1) \\\\wedge \\\\psi(x_1, x_2)\\\\).  \\n\\\\(\\\\qquad\\\\vdots\\\\)  \\n\\\\(\\\\phi_n\\\\) is the expression\\n\\\\(\\\\psi(x_0, x_1) \\\\wedge \\\\ldots \\\\wedge \\\\psi(x_n,\\nx_{n+1})\\\\).  \\nThe crucial lemma, referred to above, shows that from \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) we can\\nderive for each \\\\(n, \\\\exists x_0 \\\\ldots \\\\exists x_{n+1}\\\\phi_{n}\\\\).  \\nFor some \\\\(n,\\n\\\\phi_n\\\\) is not satisfiable. Then, Gödel\\nargued, using the already known completeness theorem for propositional\\n logic, that \\\\(\\\\neg \\\\phi_n\\\\) is provable, and hence so is\\n\\\\(\\\\forall x_0 ,\\\\ldots ,x_{n+1}\\\\neg \\\\phi_{n}\\\\). Thus\\n\\\\(\\\\neg \\\\exists x_0 \\\\ldots \\\\exists x_{n+1}\\\\phi_{n}\\\\)\\nis provable and therefore the \\\\(\\\\neg \\\\phi\\\\) is provable, i.e., \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is\\nrefutable in the Hilbert-Ackermann system. (Some partial results about\\npropositional logic in addition to those already mentioned include the\\nsemantic completeness of the propositional calculus due to Post\\n(1921), as well as a more general completeness theorem for the same\\ndue to Bernays in 1918; the latter appears in Bernays’\\nunpublished of 1918; see also Bernays\\n1926.)  \\nCase 1:  \\n[ ]  \\n7  \\nHabilitationsschrift  \\nEach \\\\(\\\\phi_n\\\\) is\\nsatisfiable. There are only finitely many possible models with\\nuniverse \\\\(\\\\{x_0 ,\\\\ldots ,x_{n+1}\\\\}\\\\).\\nGödel orders them as a tree by defining a model \\\\(M\\\\) to be\\nbelow a model \\\\(M'\\\\) if \\\\(M\\\\) is a submodel of\\n\\\\(M'\\\\). In this way we obtain a tree which is finitely\\nbranching but infinite. By König’s Lemma there is an\\ninfinite branch \\\\(B\\\\). (In the proof, Gödel explicitly\\nconstructs the branch given by König’s Lemma rather than\\nciting it by name.) The union of the models on \\\\(B\\\\) forms a\\nmodel \\\\(M\\\\) with universe \\\\(\\\\{x_0,\\nx_1 ,\\\\ldots \\\\}\\\\). Since \\\\(M\\\\) satisfies each\\n\\\\(\\\\phi_n\\\\), the original formula \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) holds in\\n\\\\(M\\\\). So \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) is satisfiable and we are done.  \\nCase 2:  \\nNote that the model, in the satisfiability case of Gödel’s\\nproof, is always countable. Thus this proof of the Completeness\\nTheorem gives also the Löweheim-Skolem Theorem (see below).\\nGödel extends the result to countably many formulas and to the\\ncase of first order logic with identity. He also proves the\\nindependence of the axioms.  \\nIn 1930 Gödel published the paper based on his thesis (Gödel\\n1930) notable also for the inclusion of the compactness theorem, which\\nis only implicitly stated in the thesis. The theorem as stated by\\nGödel in Gödel 1930 is as follows: a countably infinite set\\nof quantificational formulas is satisfiable if and only if every\\nfinite subset of those formulas is satisfiable. Gödel uses\\ncompactness to derive a generalization of the completeness\\ntheorem.  \\nThe Compactness Theorem was extended to the case of uncountable\\nvocabularies by Maltsev in 1936 (see Mal’cev 1971), from which\\nthe Upward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem immediately follows.

One of the main consequences\\nof the completeness theorem is that categoricity fails for Peano\\narithmetic and for Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.  \\nIn detail, regarding the first order Peano axioms (henceforth\\n\\\\(PA)\\\\), the existence of non-standard models of them actually\\nfollows from completeness together with compactness.

But Skolem never\\nmentions the fact that the existence of such models follows from the\\ncompleteness and compactness theorems. Gödel in his review\\n(1934c) of Skolem’s paper also does not mention this fact,\\nrather observing that the failure of categoricity for arithmetic\\nfollows from the theorem.  \\nincompleteness  \\nAs for set theory, the failure of categoricity was already taken note\\nof by Skolem in 1923, because it follows from the\\nLöwenheim-Skolem Theorem (which Skolem arrived at that year; see\\nSkolem 1923, based on Löwenheim 1915 and Skolem 1920): any first\\norder theory in a countable language that has a model has a countable\\nmodel.  \\nSkolem’s observation that categoricity fails for set theory\\nbecause it has countable models is now known as the Skolem\\n paradox. The\\n observation is strongly emphasized in Skolem’s paper, which is\\naccordingly entitled ‘An Observation on the Axiomatic\\nFoundations of Set Theory’ As he wrote in the conclusion of it,\\nhe had not pointed out the relativity in set theory already in 1915\\nbecause:  \\n[ ]  \\n8  \\n… first, I have in the meantime been occupied with other\\nproblems; second, I believed that it was so clear that axiomatization\\nin terms of sets was not a satisfactory ultimate foundation of\\nmathematics that mathematicians would, for the most part, not be very\\nmuch concerned with it. But in recent times I have seen to my surprise\\nthat so many mathematicians think that these axioms of set theory\\nprovide the ideal foundation for mathematics; therefore it seemed to\\nme that the time had come to publish a critique. (English translation\\ntaken from van Heijenoort 1967, p. 300.)  \\nAs an aside, in the proof of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem,\\nspecifically that part of the theorem in which one constructs a model\\nfor a satisfiable sentence, Löwenheim and Skolem’s tree\\nconstruction was more or less the same as appears in\\nGödel’s thesis. In a 1967 letter to Hao Wang, Gödel\\ntakes note of the fact that his completeness proof had almost been\\nobtained by Skolem in 1923. Though van Heijenoort and Dreben (Dreben\\nand van Heijenoort 1986) remark that “Throughout much of the\\n1920s it was not semantic completeness but the decision problem for\\nquantificational validity, a problem originating from the work of\\nSchröder and Löwenheim, that was the dominant concern in\\nstudying quantification theory” (examples of such results would\\ninclude the decision procedure for the first order monadic predicate\\ncalculus due to Behmann, (Behmann 1922)), according to Gödel, the\\nreasons that Skolem did not obtain the complete proof are different\\nand philosophically important, having to do with the then dominant\\nbias against semantics and against infinitary methods:  \\nThe Completeness Theorem, mathematically, is indeed an almost trivial\\nconsequence of Skolem 1923. However, the fact is that, at that time,\\nnobody (including Skolem himself) drew this conclusion neither from\\nSkolem 1923 nor, as I did, from similar considerations of his own\\n…This blindness (or prejudice, or whatever you may call it) of\\nlogicians is indeed surprising.

This material had\\nformed the basis of Wang’s “Some Facts about Kurt\\nGödel,” and was read and approved by Gödel:  \\nLogical Journey  \\nIn the summer of 1930 I began to study the consistency problem of\\nclassical analysis. It is mysterious why Hilbert wanted to prove\\ndirectly the consistency of analysis by finitary methods. I saw two\\ndistinguishable problems: to prove the consistency of number theory by\\nfinitary number theory and to prove the consistency of analysis by\\nnumber theory … Since the domain of finitary number theory was\\nnot well-defined, I began by tackling the second half… I\\nrepresented real numbers by predicates in number theory… and\\nfound that I had to use the concept of truth (for number theory) to\\nverify the axioms of analysis. By an enumeration of symbols, sentences\\nand proofs within the given system, I quickly discovered that the\\nconcept of arithmetic truth cannot be defined in arithmetic. If it\\nwere possible to define truth in the system itself, we would have\\nsomething like the liar paradox, showing the system to be\\ninconsistent… Note that this argument can be formalized to show\\nthe existence of undecidable propositions without giving any\\nindividual instances. (If there were no undecidable propositions, all\\n(and only) true propositions would be provable within the system. But\\nthen we would have a contradiction.)… In contrast to truth,\\nprovability in a given formal system is an explicit combinatorial\\nproperty of certain sentences of the system, which is formally\\nspecifiable by suitable elementary means…  \\nWe see that Gödel first tried to reduce the consistency problem\\nfor analysis to that of arithmetic. This seemed to require a truth\\ndefinition for arithmetic, which in turn led to paradoxes, such as the\\nLiar paradox (“This sentence is false”) and Berry’s\\nparadox (“The least number not defined by an expression\\nconsisting of just fourteen English words”). Gödel then\\nnoticed that such paradoxes would not necessarily arise if truth were\\nreplaced by provability. But this means that arithmetic truth and\\narithmetic provability are not co-extensive — whence the First\\nIncompleteness Theorem.  \\nThis account of Gödel’s discovery was told to Hao Wang very\\nmuch after the fact; but in Gödel’s contemporary\\ncorrespondence with Bernays and Zermelo, essentially the same\\ndescription of his path to the theorems is given. (See Gödel\\n2003a and Gödel 2003b respectively.) From those accounts we see\\nthat the undefinability of truth in arithmetic, a result credited to\\nTarski, was likely obtained in some form by Gödel by 1931. But he\\nneither publicized nor published the result; the biases logicians had\\nexpressed at the time concerning the notion of truth, biases which\\ncame vehemently to the fore when Tarski announced his results on the\\nundefinability of truth in formal systems 1935, may have served as a\\ndeterrent to Gödel’s publication of that theorem.'),\n",

Gödel himself\\nused a system related to that defined in Principia Mathematica, but\\ncontaining Peano arithmetic. In our presentation of the First and\\nSecond Incompleteness Theorems we refer to Peano arithmetic as\\n\\\\(P\\\\), following Gödel’s notation.  \\nBefore proceeding to the details of the formal proof, we define the\\nnotion of \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)-consistency used by Gödel in the First\\nIncompleteness Theorem: \\\\(P\\\\) is if\\n\\\\(P \\\\vdash \\\\neg \\\\phi(\\\\underline{n})\\\\) for all \\\\(n\\\\)\\nimplies \\\\(P \\\\not\\\\vdash \\\\exists x\\\\phi(x)\\\\).\\nNaturally this implies consistency and follows from the assumption\\nthat the natural numbers satisfy the axioms of Peano arithmetic.  \\n\\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)-consistent  \\nOne of the main technical tools used in the proof is , a mechanism which assigns natural numbers to terms and\\nformulas of our formal theory \\\\(P\\\\). There are different ways of\\ndoing this. The most common is based on the unique representation of\\nnatural numbers as products of powers of primes. Each symbol\\n\\\\(s\\\\) of number theory is assigned a positive natural number\\n\\\\(\\\\num(s)\\\\) in a fixed but arbitrary way, e.g.  \\nGödel\\nnumbering  \\nThe natural number corresponding to a sequence \\\\(w = \\\\lt w_0 ,\\\\ldots ,w_k \\\\gt\\\\)\\nof symbols is  \\nwhere \\\\(p_k\\\\) is the \\\\(k+1\\\\)st prime. It\\nis called its Gödel number and denoted by\\n\\\\(\\\\ulcorner w\\\\urcorner\\\\). In this way we can\\nassign Gödel numbers to formulas, sequences of formulas (once a\\nmethod for distinguishing when one formula ends and another begins has\\nbeen adopted), and most notably, proofs.  \\nAn essential point here is that when a formula is construed as a\\nnatural number, then the numeral corresponding to that natural number\\ncan occur as the argument of a formula, thus enabling the syntax to\\n“refer” to itself, so to speak (i.e., when a numeral is\\nsubstituted into a formula the Gödel number of which the numeral\\nrepresents). This will eventually allow Gödel to formalize the\\nLiar paradox (with “provability” in place of\\n“truth”) by substituting into the formula which says,\\n‘the formula, whose code is \\\\(x\\\\), is unprovable,’\\nits own natural number code (or more precisely the corresponding\\nnumeral).  \\nAnother concept required to carry out the formalization is the concept\\nof numeralwise expressibility of number theoretic predicates. A\\nnumber-theoretic formula \\\\(\\\\phi(n_1 , \\\\ldots ,n_k)\\\\) is in\\n\\\\(P\\\\) if for each tuple of natural numbers\\n\\\\((n_1 , \\\\ldots ,n_k)\\\\):  \\nnumeralwise expressible  \\nwhere \\\\(\\\\underline{n}\\\\) is the formal term which denotes the natural\\nnumber \\\\(n\\\\). (In \\\\(P\\\\), this is\\n\\\\(S(S(\\\\ldots S\\\\)(0)…), where \\\\(n\\\\)\\nis the number of iterations of the successor function applied to the\\nconstant symbol 0.) One of the principal goals is to numeralwise\\nexpress the predicate  \\n\\\\(\\\\Prf(x, y)\\\\): ‘the sequence with Gödel\\nnumber \\\\(x\\\\) is a proof of the sentence with Gödel number\\n\\\\(y\\\\).’  \\nReaching this goal involves defining forty-five relations, each\\ndefined in terms of the preceding ones. These relations are all\\nprimitive\\n recursive. Relations needed are, among others, those which assert of a natural\\nnumber that it codes a sequence, or a formula, or an axiom, or that it\\nis the code, denoted by\\n\\\\(\\\\text{Sb}(r^{u_1 \\\\ldots u_n}_{Z(x_1)\\\\ldots Z(x_n)})\\\\),\\nof a formula obtained from a formula with code \\\\(r\\\\) by\\nsubstituting for its free variable \\\\(u_i\\\\) the\\n\\\\(x_i\\\\) th numeral for \\\\(i = 1,\\n\\\\ldots ,n\\\\). The forty-fifth primitive recursive relation\\ndefined is \\\\(\\\\Prf(x, y)\\\\), and the forty-sixth is  \\n[ ]  \\n10  \\n\\\\(\\\\Prov(y)\\\\): ‘the sentence with Gödel number\\n\\\\(y\\\\) is provable in \\\\(P\\\\)’  \\nwhich without being primitive recursive, is however obtained from\\n\\\\(\\\\Prf(x, y)\\\\) by existentially quantifying \\\\(x\\\\).\\n(\\\\(\\\\Prov(y)\\\\) satisfies only the ‘positive’ part of\\nnumeralwise expressibility, and not the negative part; but the\\nnegative part is not needed.)  \\nIn Theorem V of his paper, Gödel proves that any number theoretic\\npredicate which is primitive recursive is numeralwise expressible in\\n\\\\(P\\\\). Thus since \\\\(\\\\Prf(x, y)\\\\) and substitution\\nare primitive recursive, these are decided by \\\\(P\\\\) when closed\\nterms are substituted for the free variables \\\\(x\\\\) and\\n\\\\(y\\\\). This is the heart of the matter as we will see. Another\\nkey point about numeralwise expressibility is that although we\\ninformally interpret, for example,\\n\\\\(\\\\Prov(\\\\text{Sb}(r^{u_1 \\\\ldots u_n}_{Z(x_1)\\\\ldots Z(x_n)}))\\\\),\\nby: ‘the formula with Gödel number \\\\(r\\\\) is provable\\nif the Gödel number for the \\\\(x_i\\\\) th numeral is\\nsubstituted in place of the \\\\(i\\\\) th variable,’ neither the\\nformal statement within the theory \\\\(P\\\\) nor anything we prove\\nabout it appeals to such meanings. On the contrary\\n\\\\(\\\\Prov(\\\\text{Sb}(r^{u_1 \\\\ldots u_n}_{Z(x_1)\\\\ldots Z(x_n)}))\\\\),\\nis a meaningless string of logical and arithmetical symbols. As\\nGödel puts it in his introduction to his theorem V, ‘The\\nfact that can be formulated vaguely by saying that every recursive\\nrelation is definable in the system \\\\(P\\\\) (if the usual meaning\\nis given to the formulas of this system) is expressed in precise\\nlanguage, reference to any interpretation of the\\nformulas of \\\\(P\\\\), by the following Theorem (V) (Gödel 1986,\\np. 171, italics Gödel’s).  \\nwithout  \\nGödel in his incompleteness theorems uses a method given in what\\nis called nowadays Gödel’s Fixed Point Theorem. Although\\nGödel constructs a fixed point in the course of proving the\\nincompleteness theorem, he does not state the fixed point theorem\\nexplicitly. The fixed point theorem is as follows:  \\n(Gödel’s Fixed Point Theorem) If \\\\(\\\\phi(v_0)\\\\) is a formula of number theory, then\\nthere is a sentence \\\\(\\\\psi\\\\) such that \\\\(P \\\\vdash \\\\psi \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\phi(\\\\ulcorner \\\\underline{\\\\psi}\\\\urcorner)\\\\), where\\n\\\\(\\\\ulcorner \\\\underline{\\\\psi}\\\\urcorner\\\\) is the formal term\\ncorresponding to the natural number code of\\n\\\\(\\\\ulcorner \\\\psi \\\\urcorner\\\\).  \\nTheorem 2  \\nLet \\\\(\\\\sigma(x,y,z)\\\\) be a\\nformula that numeralwise expresses the number theoretic predicate\\n‘\\\\(y\\\\) is the Gödel number of the formula obtained by\\nreplacing the variable \\\\(v_0\\\\) in the formula whose\\nGödel number is \\\\(x\\\\) by the term \\\\(\\\\underline{z}\\\\)’.\\nLet \\\\(\\\\theta(v_0)\\\\) be the formula\\n\\\\(\\\\exists v_1 (\\\\phi(v_1) \\\\wedge \\\\sigma(v_0, v_1,\\nv_0))\\\\).

Now directly by the construction\\n\\\\(P \\\\vdash \\\\psi \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\phi(\\\\ulcorner \\\\psi \\\\urcorner)\\\\).  \\nProof:  \\nA sentence is refutable from a theory if its negation is provable. The\\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem as Gödel stated it is as\\nfollows:  \\n\\\\[P \\\\vdash \\\\neg\\\\Prf(\\\\underline{n}, \\\\ulcorner \\\\underline{\\\\phi}\\\\urcorner)\\\\] \\\\[P \\\\not\\\\vdash \\\\exists x\\\\Prf(x,\\\\ulcorner \\\\underline{\\\\phi}\\\\urcorner).\\\\]  \\n(Gödel’s First Incompleteness\\nTheorem) If \\\\(P\\\\) is \\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)-consistent, then there is a sentence which is\\nneither provable nor refutable from \\\\(P\\\\).  \\nTheorem 3  \\nBy judicious coding of syntax referred to above, write\\na formula\\n \\\\(\\\\Prf(x,y)\\\\) of number theory, representable in \\\\(P\\\\), so that  \\nProof:  \\n[ ]  \\n11  \\n\\\\(n\\\\) codes a proof of \\\\(\\\\phi \\\\Rightarrow P \\\\vdash\\\\)\\n\\\\(\\\\Prf(\\\\underline{n},\\n\\\\ulcorner \\\\underline{\\\\phi}\\\\urcorner)\\\\).  \\nand  \\n\\\\(n\\\\) does not code a proof of \\\\(\\\\phi \\\\Rightarrow P \\\\vdash \\\\neg\\\\)Prf\\\\((\\\\underline{n},\\n\\\\ulcorner \\\\underline{\\\\phi}\\\\urcorner)\\\\).  \\nLet \\\\(Prov(y)\\\\) denote the formula \\\\(\\\\exists x\\\\Prf(x,y)\\\\) .\\n By Theorem 2 there is a sentence \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) with the property  \\n[ ]  \\n12  \\n\\\\(P \\\\vdash(\\\\phi \\\\leftrightarrow \\\\neg\\\\Prov(\\\\ulcorner \\\\underline{\\\\phi}\\\\urcorner))\\\\).  \\nThus \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) says ‘I am not provable.’ We now observe, if\\n\\\\(P \\\\vdash \\\\phi\\\\), then by (1) there is \\\\(n\\\\) such that\\n\\\\(P \\\\vdash\\\\Prf(\\\\underline{n},\\n\\\\ulcorner \\\\underline{\\\\phi}\\\\urcorner)\\\\), hence \\\\(P \\\\vdash\\\\Prov(\\\\ulcorner \\\\underline{\\\\phi}\\\\urcorner)\\\\), hence,\\nby (3) \\\\(P \\\\vdash \\\\neg \\\\phi\\\\), so \\\\(P\\\\) is inconsistent.\\nThus  \\n\\\\(P \\\\not\\\\vdash \\\\phi\\\\)  \\nFurthermore, by (4) and (2), we have  \\nfor all natural numbers \\\\(n\\\\).

Rosser’s generalization involves applying\\nthe fixed point theorem to the formula \\\\(R(x)\\\\):\\n‘for all \\\\(z\\\\): either \\\\(z\\\\) is not the Gödel\\nnumber of a proof of the formula with Gödel number \\\\(x\\\\) or\\nthere is a proof shorter than \\\\(z\\\\) of the negation of (the\\nformula with Gödel number) \\\\(x\\\\)’ (see Rosser\\n1936).  \\nWith regard to the Second Incompleteness Theorem, the argument relies\\nin part on formalizing the proof of the First Incompleteness Theorem\\nas we saw. This step is omitted in Gödel 1931. He planned to\\ninclude the step in what would have been a second part II (see\\nfootnote 48a of Gödel 1931). But instead of writing it he turned\\nto the continuum\\n problem. (Part II was to elaborate on other points too: the ‘true reason\\nfor incompleteness,’ and the applicability of the two theorems\\nto other systems.) He perhaps did not feel compelled to attend to what\\nlooked like an exercise in formalization, relying instead on the\\ninformal argument to convince (in which it succeeded). However this\\nstep turned out to be somewhat non-trivial. As Kleene puts it in his\\nintroduction to Gödel 1931, of the informal presentation,\\n“Certainly the idea of the argument for Theorem XI (consistency)\\nwas very convincing; but it turned out that the execution of the\\ndetails required somewhat more work and care than had been\\nanticipated.” (See pp. 126–141 of Gödel 1986.)\\nEventually a complete proof of the Second Theorem was given by Hilbert\\nand Bernays in some seventy pages in their Hilbert and Bernays 1939.

Gödel’s Mathematical Work', 'Header 3': '2.3 Speed-up Theorems'}, page_content='Gödel’s 1936 ‘Speed-up’ theorem, published in\\nan abstract “On the length of proofs”, Gödel 1936\\nsays that while some sentences of arithmetic are true but unprovable,\\nthere are other sentences which are provable, but even the shortest\\nproof is longer than any bound given in advance as a recursive\\nfunction of the sentence. More exactly:  \\nGiven any recursive function \\\\(f\\\\) there are provable sentences\\n\\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) of arithmetic such that the shortest proof is greater than\\n\\\\(f(\\\\ulcorner \\\\phi \\\\urcorner)\\\\) in length.  \\nTheorem 5  \\nThe proof we will outline is sensitive to the particular concept we\\nuse for the length of a proof. Another possibility, and the one that\\nGödel has in mind, is the number of formulas in the proof. Buss\\n(see below) proves the theorem in either case, so both cases are\\nresolved.  \\nLet \\\\(f\\\\) be total recursive function. By\\nGödel’s Fixed Point theorem there is a formula\\n\\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\) stating ‘\\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\) has no proof in PA\\nshorter than \\\\(f(n)\\\\)’. This is tenable if the\\nlength is measured by number of symbols, because we only need to\\nsearch through finitely many proofs shorter than\\n\\\\(f(n)\\\\). Note that \\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\) is true for all\\n\\\\(n\\\\), for if \\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\) were false, then there would be a\\nshort proof of \\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\), and hence by soundness\\n\\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\) would be true, a contradiction: \\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\)\\nwould both true and false. This can be formalized in PA and thus we\\nget the result that for each \\\\(n\\\\) the sentence \\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\)\\nis provable in PA. Since \\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\) is true for all \\\\(n\\\\),\\nit cannot have a proof in PA which is shorter than\\n\\\\(f(n)\\\\).  \\nProof:  \\nThe Speed-up Theorem is the result of contemplating and elaborating\\nthe proof of the incompleteness theorem. It applies the fixed-point\\ntechnique to the concept of unprovability by a short proof, as opposed\\nto the original idea of applying the fixed-point theorem to mere\\nunprovability. The proof has very much the same flavor as the proof of\\nthe incompleteness theorem. Interestingly, it dates from the same year\\nas the construction, due to Rosser, that eliminates the use of\\n\\\\(\\\\omega\\\\)-consistency in the first Incompleteness Theorem; like the\\nSpeed-up Theorem of Gödel, Rosser’s construction exploits\\nthe issue of short and long proofs. Gödel never submitted a proof\\nfor the Speed-up Theorem. Over the years several related proofs were\\npublished, but the first full proof of Gödel’s original\\nresult was given only in 1994 by Sam Buss in his ‘On\\nGödel’s theorems on lengths of proofs I: Number of lines\\nand speedups for arithmetic.’ (Buss 1994). Buss also gives a\\nsecond proof of the theorem which avoids self-reference, following a\\ntechnique due to Statman. Gödel measures the length of proofs by\\nthe number of formulas; but there are also other possibilities, such\\nas the number of symbols in the proof. The case of the Speed-up\\nTheorem where the length of proof is measured by the number of symbols\\nwas proved by Mostowski in 1952 (Mostowski 1982). For proofs of\\nsimilar results see Ehrenfeucht and Mycieleski 1971, and Parikh 1971.\\nThough both measures may be equally natural candidates for measuring\\nthe length of a proof, proving the theorem for length measured by the\\nnumber of symbols avoids a technical complication introduced by the\\nother measure: there are only finitely many proofs with a given number\\nof symbols, whereas there are infinitely many proofs with a given\\nnumber of formulas.  \\nGödel states the Speed-up Theorem differently from the above. Let\\n\\\\(S_n\\\\) be the system of logic of the \\\\(n\\\\)-th\\norder, the variables of the first level being thought of as ranging\\nover natural numbers. In this setting, variables of the second level\\nrange over sets of natural numbers and so on. Gödel’s\\nformulation is:  \\nLet \\\\(n\\\\) be a natural number \\\\(\\\\gt 0\\\\). If \\\\(f\\\\) is a\\ncomputable function, then there are infinitely many formulas\\n\\\\(A\\\\), provable in \\\\(S_n\\\\), such that if\\n\\\\(k\\\\) is the length of the shortest proof of \\\\(A\\\\) in\\n\\\\(S_n\\\\) and \\\\(l\\\\) is the length of the\\nshortest proof of \\\\(A\\\\) in \\\\(S_{n+1}\\\\),\\nthen \\\\(k \\\\gt f(l)\\\\).  \\nTheorem 6  \\nThe idea is the following: Let\\n\\\\(\\\\phi(x)\\\\) be a formula, like above, for which\\n\\\\(\\\\phi(m)\\\\) does not have a short proof in\\n\\\\(S_n\\\\) for any \\\\(m\\\\). Suppose we have a\\nhigher type system \\\\(S_{n+1}\\\\) in which we can\\nprove \\\\(\\\\forall x\\\\phi(x)\\\\). This proof is of constant\\nlength. Thus each \\\\(\\\\phi(m)\\\\) is derivable from this universal\\nstatement by one application of the logical rule\\n\\\\(\\\\forall x\\\\phi(x) \\\\rightarrow \\\\phi(t)\\\\). Thus\\n\\\\(\\\\phi(m)\\\\) has in that system for all \\\\(m\\\\) a short\\nproof.  \\nProof sketch:  \\nWhat kind of stronger system can we have in which\\n\\\\(\\\\forall x\\\\phi(x)\\\\) is provable? We may consider\\nsecond order logic in which we can define a predicate\\n\\\\(N(x)\\\\) for the set of natural numbers and furthermore\\ncan prove of a new predicate symbol \\\\(Tr(x)\\\\) that it\\nsatisfies the inductive clauses of the truth definition of first order\\nformulas of arithmetic, relativized to \\\\(N\\\\). Then the stronger\\nsystem can prove that provable first order sentences of arithmetic\\nsatisfy the predicate \\\\(Tr\\\\) . By the above argument, we can\\nprove in the stronger system that \\\\(\\\\forall x\\\\phi(x)\\\\)\\nsatisfies \\\\(Tr\\\\). Then by adding a few lines we can prove each\\n\\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\) satisfies \\\\(Tr\\\\). Because of the nature of\\n\\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\), this implies the stronger system has a (short)\\nproof of \\\\(\\\\phi(n)\\\\). An alternative system is Peano’s\\naxioms PA in an extended language where we have a new predicate symbol\\n\\\\(Tr\\\\) and axioms stating that the predicate \\\\(Tr\\\\) codes\\nthe satisfaction relation for all sentences of the vocabulary not\\ncontaining \\\\(Tr\\\\).'),\n",

Though completely definitive, the 1939\\nversion is lacking in a great many details, most notably the arguments\\nshowing that if \\\\(L\\\\) is built inside \\\\(L\\\\) itself, the same\\n\\\\(L\\\\) results; that is to say, the so-called absoluteness\\narguments are missing. Also missing are the details of the proofs that\\nthe \\\\(ZF\\\\) axioms hold in \\\\(L\\\\). Unlike the case of the\\nSecond Incompleteness Theorem, however, Gödel subsequently gave a\\ncompletely detailed proof of the two theorems in the 1940 monograph.\\n(The 1940 proof differs substantially from the first version. For\\ndetails about the two proofs and the difference between them the\\nreader is referred to Solovay 1990 and Kanamori 2006.)  \\nWe now sketch the proof of the consistency of \\\\(CH\\\\) and of\\n\\\\(AC\\\\) with \\\\(ZFC\\\\), using modern terminology. Some\\npreliminary concepts before sketching the proof: We first define the\\nstratified set theoretic universe, denoted \\\\(V. (V\\\\) is\\nalso known as the cumulative hierarchy.) It is obtained by iteration\\nof the power set operation \\\\((\\\\wp)\\\\) beginning with the null set:  \\nwhere \\\\(\\\\alpha , \\\\beta\\\\) are any ordinals, \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) is a limit ordinal and\\n\\\\(\\\\wp(x)\\\\) denotes the power set of \\\\(x\\\\). Finally  \\nwhere denotes the class of all ordinals.  \\nOrd  \\nThe constructible hierarchy \\\\(L\\\\) is likewise defined by\\nrecursion on ordinals. But whereas the full power set operation is\\niterated to obtain the cumulative hierarchy, the levels of the\\nconstructible hierarchy are defined strictly predicatively, that is by\\nincluding at the next level only those sets which are first order\\ndefinable using parameters from the previous level. More exactly, let\\n\\\\(\\\\textit{Def}(A)\\\\) denote the set of all subsets of \\\\(A\\\\)\\ndefinable in the structure \\\\(\\\\langle A, \\\\in \\\\rangle\\\\) by first order\\nformulas with parameters in \\\\(A\\\\). (For more on definability see\\nthe entry on in this encyclopedia.)  \\nmodel theory  \\nWith this notation the constructible hierarchy is defined by induction\\nover the ordinals as follows:  \\nA set \\\\(x\\\\) is said to be if \\\\(x \\\\in L\\\\). The axiom which states that all sets are\\nconstructible is denoted \\\\(V = L\\\\) and is called the\\nAxiom of Constructibility. Note that \\\\(L\\\\) is a proper class and\\nnot a set; although as we will see, each \\\\(L_{\\\\alpha}\\\\)\\nis a set, and the predicate “\\\\(x\\\\) is constructible”\\nis actually a definable term of the language.  \\nconstructible  \\nOur next task is to show that \\\\(L\\\\) is a model of \\\\(ZF\\\\). A\\nset or a class is if elements of it are also\\nsubsets. By a meticulous transfinite induction, \\\\(L_{\\\\alpha}\\\\) can be shown to be transitive for each \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\); and therefore\\nso is \\\\(L\\\\) itself. This fact, together with the observation that\\nsome elementary closure properties hold in \\\\(L\\\\) is enough to show that \\\\(L\\\\) is a model of \\\\(ZF\\\\). (Indeed,\\nas it turns out, \\\\(L\\\\) is the minimal transitive model of the\\n\\\\(ZF\\\\) axioms containing all the ordinals, and is therefore in\\nthis sense canonical.)  \\ntransitive  \\n[ ]  \\n16  \\nIn detail, proving that the \\\\(ZF\\\\) axioms, apart from the\\ncomprehension axiom, are true in \\\\(L\\\\), amounts to showing that,\\nroughly speaking, any set with a property \\\\(P\\\\) that a\\n\\\\(ZF\\\\) axiom asserts to exist, can be seen to exist in \\\\(L\\\\)\\nby considering the relativization \\\\(P^L\\\\) of the\\nproperty \\\\(P\\\\) to \\\\(L\\\\). (A property \\\\(P\\\\) is\\nrelativized to an inner model \\\\(M\\\\) by replacing every quantifier\\n\\\\(\\\\exists x\\\\phi\\\\) by \\\\(\\\\exists x(x \\\\in M \\\\wedge \\\\phi)\\\\) and every quantifier \\\\(\\\\forall x\\\\phi\\\\)\\nby \\\\(\\\\forall x(x \\\\in M\\\\rightarrow \\\\phi)\\\\).) As\\nfor the comprehension axiom, verifying it requires showing that the\\nset asserted to exist is constructed at a particular successor level\\n\\\\(L_{\\\\alpha + 1}\\\\). Proving this requires an important\\nprinciple of set theory which in modern terminology is called the Levy\\n(or \\\\(ZF)\\\\) Reflection Principle. This principle says that any\\nstatement in the language of \\\\(ZF\\\\) which is true in \\\\(V\\\\)\\nis already true on some level of any continuously increasing hierarchy\\nsuch as \\\\(L\\\\). (For the history of this principle, see Kanamori\\n2006.) The Levy Reflection Principle gives the level \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) at which\\nthe elements of the set are all constructed. Gödel did not\\nactually have the Levy Reflection Principle but used the argument\\nbehind the proof of the principle.  \\nOnce it is established that \\\\(L\\\\) is a model of \\\\(ZF\\\\), one\\ncan now prove that both the \\\\(CH\\\\) and the \\\\(AC\\\\) hold in\\n\\\\(L\\\\). To this end, one first shows that the definition of\\n\\\\(L\\\\) is for \\\\(L\\\\), where absoluteness is\\ndefined as follows: given a class \\\\(M\\\\), a predicate\\n\\\\(P(x)\\\\) is said to be absolute for \\\\(M\\\\) if and\\nonly if for all \\\\(x \\\\in M, P(x)\\n\\\\leftrightarrow P^M (x)\\\\).  \\nabsolute  \\nProving that the predicate “\\\\(x\\\\) is constructible”\\nis absolute requires formalizing the notion of definability, which in\\nturn requires formalizing the notion of satisfaction. This is because\\nthe predicate “\\\\(x\\\\) is constructible” says of a set,\\nthat for some ordinal \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\), and for some formula \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\) with\\nparameters in \\\\(L_{\\\\alpha}, x = \\\\{y \\\\in L_{\\\\alpha} | L_{\\\\alpha} \\\\vDash \\\\phi(y)\\\\}\\\\). This part of the proof is tedious but\\nunproblematic.  \\nOnce the absoluteness of \\\\(L\\\\) is established, it follows that\\n\\\\(ZF\\\\) satisfies the axiom of constructibility if it is\\nrelativized to \\\\(L\\\\); that is, \\\\(ZF \\\\vdash\\n(V=L)^L\\\\). In particular, the axiom \\\\(V = L\\\\) is\\nconsistent if \\\\(ZF\\\\) is.  \\nWe now give the idea of the proof of \\\\(CH\\\\) and \\\\(AC\\\\) in\\n\\\\(ZF + V = L\\\\). (For a detailed exposition of\\nthe proof, the reader is referred to the standard sources. See for\\nexample Devlin’s chapter on constructibility in Barwise 1977;\\nsee also Kunen 1983, and Jech 2003.)  \\nAs concerns the \\\\(CH\\\\), the idea behind the proof of it in\\n\\\\(L\\\\) is simply the following: Gödel showed that assuming\\n\\\\(V = L\\\\), every real number occurs on some countable\\nlevel of the \\\\(L\\\\)-hierarchy. Since every countable level is\\nitself countable (after all, there are only countably many possible\\ndefining formulas), and there are \\\\(\\\\omega_1\\\\) countable\\nlevels, there must be only \\\\(\\\\omega_1\\\\) real numbers.  \\nThe difficulty here, if not of the whole proof altogether, lies in\\nshowing that every real is constructed already on a countable level of\\nthe \\\\(L\\\\)-hierarchy. To show this Gödel argued as follows:\\nSuppose \\\\(A\\\\) is a real number thought of as a set of natural\\nnumbers. By a combination of the Levy Reflection principle and the\\nLöwenheim-Skolem Theorem there is a countable submodel \\\\(\\\\langle M, \\\\in \\\\rangle\\\\) of \\\\(\\\\langle L, \\\\in \\\\rangle\\\\) satisfying a\\nsufficiently large part of the \\\\(ZF\\\\) axioms \\\\(+ V = L\\\\), such that \\\\(A\\\\) belongs to \\\\(M\\\\).\\nBy a simple procedure \\\\(\\\\langle M, \\\\in \\\\rangle\\\\) can be converted\\ninto a transitive model \\\\(\\\\langle N, \\\\in \\\\rangle\\\\). This procedure,\\nused by Gödel already in 1937, was explicitly isolated by\\nMostowski (Mostowski 1949). The resulting model is referred to as the\\nMostowski Collapse.  \\nfinite  \\nLet us pause to discuss this important technique. Suppose \\\\(\\\\langle M, E\\\\rangle\\\\) is a well-founded model of the axiom of\\nextensionality. It is a consequence of the well-foundedness of the\\nbinary predicate \\\\(E\\\\) on \\\\(M\\\\), and of the principle of\\ntransfinite recursion, that the equation \\\\(\\\\pi(x) = \\\\{\\\\pi(y) | y \\\\in M \\\\wedge\\nyEx\\\\}\\\\) defines a unique function on \\\\(M\\\\). The range\\n\\\\(N\\\\) of \\\\(\\\\pi\\\\) is transitive, for if \\\\(\\\\pi(a) \\\\in N\\\\) and \\\\(y \\\\in \\\\pi(a)\\\\), then \\\\(y = \\\\pi(b)\\\\) for some \\\\(b \\\\in M\\\\) with\\n\\\\(bEa\\\\), whence \\\\(\\\\pi(b) \\\\in N\\\\). The fact that\\n\\\\(\\\\pi\\\\) is an isomorphism between \\\\(\\\\langle M, E\\\\rangle\\\\) and\\n\\\\(\\\\langle N, \\\\in \\\\rangle\\\\) can be proved by transfinite induction on\\nelements on \\\\(M\\\\), based again on the well-foundedness of\\n\\\\(E\\\\). The well-foundedness of \\\\(\\\\langle M, E\\\\rangle\\\\) is\\nin practice often the consequence of \\\\(\\\\langle M, E\\\\rangle\\\\)\\nbeing a submodel of some \\\\(\\\\langle V_{\\\\alpha}, \\\\varepsilon \\\\rangle\\\\).  \\nWe now return to the proof of the \\\\(CH\\\\) in \\\\(L\\\\). We used\\nthe Mostowski Collapse to construct the transitive set \\\\(N\\\\). As\\nit turns out, the real number \\\\(A\\\\) is still an element of \\\\(\\\\langle N, \\\\in \\\\rangle\\\\) . By basic properties of \\\\(L, \\\\langle N, \\\\in \\\\rangle\\\\) must be \\\\(\\\\langle L_{\\\\alpha},\\n\\\\in \\\\rangle\\\\) for some \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\) . Since \\\\(N\\\\) is countable, \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)\\nis countable too. (It can be shown that \\\\(|L_{\\\\alpha}|\\n= |\\\\alpha | + \\\\aleph_0\\\\).) Thus \\\\(A\\\\) is constructible\\non a countable level, which was to have been shown.  \\nAs for the \\\\(AC\\\\), Gödel exhibits a definable well-ordering,\\nthat is, a formula of set theory which defines, in \\\\(L\\\\), a\\nwell-ordering of all of \\\\(L\\\\). The formula is tedious to write\\ndown but the idea is a simple one: A set \\\\(x\\\\) precedes a set\\n\\\\(y\\\\) in the well-ordering if and only if either \\\\(x\\\\)\\noccurs in the \\\\(L\\\\)-hierarchy on an earlier level\\n\\\\(L_{\\\\alpha}\\\\) than \\\\(y\\\\), or else they occur on\\nthe same level but \\\\(x\\\\) is defined by a shorter formula than\\n\\\\(y\\\\), or else they are defined by the same formula but the\\nparameters in the definition of \\\\(x\\\\) occur in \\\\(L\\\\) earlier\\nthan the parameters of \\\\(y\\\\). This well-ordering of \\\\(L\\\\)\\nshows that the \\\\(AC\\\\) holds in \\\\(L\\\\).  \\nThis concludes the proof of the consistency of \\\\(AC\\\\) and the\\n\\\\(CH\\\\) in \\\\(L\\\\).  \\nWe note that Gödel proved more in his 1939 and 1940 than what was\\nshown here, namely he proved the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis in\\n\\\\(L\\\\) and hence that its consistency with \\\\(ZF\\\\).'),\n",

(See Scott 1961.\\nA cardinal \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\) is said to be measurable if there is a\\nnon-principal \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\)-complete ultrafilter in the power-set Boolean\\nalgebra of \\\\(\\\\kappa\\\\).) In 1963, as noted, Paul Cohen proved the\\nconsistency of the negation of the \\\\(CH\\\\) by adding\\nnon-constructible sets to an inner model.  \\nZFC  \\n[ ]  \\n17  \\nWhat other open questions of set theory could be solved by\\nGödel’s method? Gödel himself noted some consequences.\\nThey are related to so called projective sets of real numbers and\\nfinite sequences of real numbers. The simplest projective sets are the\\nclosed sets, also called \\\\(\\\\Pi^{1}_0\\\\)-sets. A set is\\n\\\\(\\\\Sigma^{1}_{n+1}\\\\) if it is the projection of\\na \\\\(\\\\Pi^{1}_n\\\\)-subset of the real plane. A\\nset is \\\\(\\\\Delta^{1}_{n+1}\\\\) if it and its\\ncomplement are \\\\(\\\\Sigma^{1}_{n+1}\\\\). Gödel\\nobserved that there is both a non-Lebesgue measurable\\n\\\\(\\\\Delta^{1}_2\\\\)-set and an uncountable\\n\\\\(\\\\Pi^{1}_1\\\\)-set without a perfect subset in\\n\\\\(L\\\\). (A set of reals is perfect if it is closed, non-empty, and\\nhas no isolated points. Such sets have the size of the continuum.)\\nGödel gave a sketch of the proof in the 1951 second printing of\\nGödel 1940.  \\nIt has turned out subsequently that the axiom \\\\(V = L\\\\)\\ngives a virtually complete extension of . This means that,\\napart from sentences arising from Gödel’s incompleteness\\ntheorems, essentially all set-theoretical questions can be decided by\\nmeans of the axioms \\\\(V = L\\\\). This is not to imply that\\nsuch results are in any way trivial. Indeed, it has turned out that\\n\\\\(L\\\\) is quite a complicated structure, despite its relatively\\nsimple description. As for settling open set-theoretical questions in\\n\\\\(L,\\\\) the main step was the emergence of Jensen’s fine\\nstructure theory of \\\\(L\\\\) (Jensen 1972). Recalling that the\\nsuccessor step \\\\(L_{\\\\alpha +1}\\\\) in the definition of\\nthe constructible hierarchy adds to \\\\(L\\\\) all subsets of\\n\\\\(L_{\\\\alpha}\\\\) definable by first order formulas \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\)\\nover \\\\((L_{\\\\alpha}, \\\\in)\\\\), fine structure theory,\\nroughly speaking, ramifies the step from \\\\(L_{\\\\alpha}\\\\)\\nto \\\\(L_{\\\\alpha +1}\\\\) into smaller steps according to the\\ncomplexity of the defining formula \\\\(\\\\phi\\\\). Jensen established by means\\nof his fine structure a strengthening, denoted by \\\\(\\\\Diamond\\\\), of\\n\\\\(CH\\\\), that he used to construct a Souslin tree in \\\\(L\\\\),\\nand a combinatorial principle \\\\(\\\\Box\\\\) that he used to show that the\\nSouslin Hypothesis is consistent with \\\\(CH\\\\).  \\nZFC'),\n",

Taken\\ntogether with his 1933e, which reduces classical first order\\narithmetic to Heyting arithmetic, a justification in these terms is\\nalso obtained for classical first order arithmetic.  \\nGödel’s inductive definition of the notion “function\\nof finite type” is as follows: (Gödel 1990, p. 245).  \\nThe functionals of type 0 are the natural numbers.  \\nIf \\\\(t_0 ,\\\\ldots ,t_k\\\\) are types and we have already defined\\nwhat functionals of types\\n\\\\(t_0 ,\\\\ldots ,t_k\\\\) are,\\nthen \\\\((t_0 ,\\\\ldots ,t_k)\\\\) is a type and a functional of that\\ntype assigns to every \\\\(k\\\\)-tuple of functionals of respective\\ntypes \\\\(t_1 ,\\\\ldots ,t_k\\\\), a functional of type\\n\\\\(t_0\\\\).  \\nGödel considers the quantifier free theory of these functionals\\nof finite type, denoted by \\\\(T. T\\\\) has the following\\nfeatures: the language of \\\\(T\\\\) contains variables of each type,\\nconstants for distinguished types, and a ternary predicate\\n\\\\(=_{\\\\sigma}\\\\) for equality for type \\\\(\\\\sigma\\\\).

As\\nGödel remarks (Gödel 1990, p. 247), the axioms for\\n\\\\(T\\\\) are essentially those of primitive recursive arithmetic,\\nexcept that the variables can be of any finite type.  \\nGödel’s translation associates with every formula\\n\\\\(F(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\) of the language of Peano arithmetic a\\nformula \\\\(F^\\\\prime(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\exists \\\\mathbf{y}\\\\forall \\\\mathbf{z}A(\\\\mathbf{y},\\n\\\\mathbf{z}, \\\\mathbf{x})\\\\) of the language of the theory\\n\\\\(T\\\\), where \\\\(A\\\\) is quantifier free and the (boldface)\\nbound variables are finite sequences of variables thought to range\\nover functionals of a finite type determined by the type of the\\nvariable.

The question addressed in\\nthe introduction to the paper is what notions must\\nbe added to finitary mathematics in order to obtain a consistency\\nproof for arithmetic. Equivalently: what does the finitary view\\npresuppose, which must be given up in the light of the Second\\nIncompleteness Theorem, if the consistency proof is to be\\nobtained:  \\nabstract  \\nIn any case Bernays’ remark teaches us to distinguish two\\ncomponents of the finitary attitude; namely, first, the constructive\\nelement, which consists in our being allowed to speak of mathematical\\nobjects only insofar as we can exhibit them or actually produce them\\nby means of a construction; second, the specifically finitistic\\nelement, which makes the further demand that the objects about which\\nwe make statements, with which the constructions are carried out and\\nwhich we obtain by means of these constructions, are\\n‘intuitive’, that is, are in the last analysis\\nspatiotemporal arrangements of elements whose characteristics other\\nthan their identity or nonidentity are irrelevant.… It is the\\nsecond requirement that must be dropped. This fact has hitherto been\\ntaken into account by our adjoining to finitary mathematics parts of\\nintuitionistic logic and the theory of ordinals. In what follows we\\nshall show that, for the consistency proof of number theory, we can\\nuse, instead, the notion of computable function of finite type on the\\nnatural numbers and certain rather elementary principles of\\nconstruction for such functions. (Gödel 1990, p.245).  \\nAside from its technical contribution, then, Gödel’s\\n1958/72 is one of Gödel’s most important philosophical\\nworks; notable for its analysis of the nature of finitary mathematics,\\nas well as its analysis of the notions of “intuitive,” as\\nin “intuitive knowledge,” and that of abstract versus\\nconcrete evidence.  \\nIn the next section, we turn to Gödel’s philosophical\\nviews.

This is a fourteen item list\\nGödel drew up in about 1960, entitled “My Philosophical\\nViewpoint.” Two items on the list are relevant here:  \\ndialectical  \\nThere are systematic methods for the solution of all problems\\n(also art, etc.).  \\nThere is a scientific (exact) philosophy and theology, which deals\\nwith concepts of the highest abstractness; and this is also most\\nhighly fruitful for science.  \\n(The list was transcribed by Cheryl Dawson and was published in , p. 316.)  \\nWang 1996  \\nGödel’s earlier conception of rationalism refers to\\nmathematical rigor and includes the concept of having a genuine proof,\\nand is therefore in some sense a more radical one than that to which\\nhe would later subscribe. One can see it at work at the end of the\\nGibbs lecture, after a sequence of arguments in favor of realism are\\ngiven:  \\nOf course I do not claim that the foregoing considerations amount to a\\nreal proof of this view about the nature of mathematics. The most I\\ncould assert would be to have disproved the nominalistic view, which\\nconsiders mathematics to consist solely in syntactical conventions and\\ntheir consequences. Moreover, I have adduced some strong arguments\\nagainst the more general view that mathematics is our own creation.\\nThere are, however, other alternatives to Platonism, in particular\\npsychologism and Aristotelian realism. In order to establish Platonic\\nrealism, these theories would have to be disproved one after the\\nother, and then it would have to be shown that they exhaust all\\npossibilities. I am not in a position to do this now; however I would\\nlike to give some indications along these lines. (Gödel 1995, p.\\n321–2).  \\n(For a penetrating analysis of this passage see Tait 2001.) Such an\\nanalysis must be based on conceptual analysis:  \\nI am under the impression that after sufficient clarification of the\\nconcepts in question it will be possible to conduct these discussions\\nwith mathematical rigour and that the result will then be…that\\nthe Platonistic view is the only one tenable. (Gödel 1995, p.\\n322).  \\nAlong with the methodological component, as can be seen from the items\\non Gödel’s list, there was also an “optimistic”\\ncomponent to Gödel’s rationalism: once the appropriate\\nmethods have been developed, philosophical problems such as, for\\nexample, those in ethics (e.g., item 9 on the list is: “Formal\\nrights comprise a real science.”) can be decisively solved. As\\nfor mathematical assertions, such as the Continuum Hypothesis in set\\ntheory, once conceptual analysis has been carried out in the right\\nway, that is, once the basic concepts, such as that of\\n“set,” have been completely clarified, the Continuum\\nHypothesis should be able to be decided.  \\nAlthough at the time of the Gibbs lecture the analogy in\\nGödel’s mind between philosophical and mathematical\\nreasoning may have been a very close one, Gödel’s view at\\nother periods was that the envisaged methods will not be mathematical\\nin nature. What was wanted was a general, informal science of\\nconceptual analysis.  \\nPhilosophy is more general than science. Already the theory of\\nconcepts is more general than mathematics…True philosophy is\\nprecise but not specialized.  \\nPerhaps the reason why no progress is made in mathematics (and there\\nare so many unsolved problems), is that one confines oneself to the\\next[ensional]—thence also the feeling of disappointment in the\\ncase of many theories, e.g., propositional logic and formalisation\\naltogether. (Wang 1996, 9.3.20,\\n 9.3.21)  \\n[ ]  \\n22  \\n(See notebook Max IV, p. 198 (Gödel Nachlaß, Firestone\\nLibrary, Princeton, item 030090). Transcription Cheryl Dawson;\\ntranslation from the German ours; amendment ours. Gödel’s\\ndating of Max IV indicates that it is from May 1941 to April 1942. See\\nalso Gödel’s letter to Bernays, Gödel 2003a, p.\\n283.)  \\nAn important source for understanding Gödel’s advance\\ntoward a general theory of concepts are Gödel’s remarks on\\nconceptual analysis published by Hao Wang in .\\nIn remark 8.6.10 for example, Gödel expresses the belief that\\nextensionality fails for concepts, contrary to what he said in his\\n1944 “Russell’s Mathematical Logic,” a remark which\\nhe now wishes to retract:  \\nLogical Journey  \\nI do not (no longer) believe that generally sameness of range is\\nsufficient to exclude the distinctness of two concepts.  \\nIn some of Gödel’s later discussions another component of\\nconceptual analysis emerges, namely the project of finding the\\nso-called primitive terms or concepts, and their relations. These are\\nroughly terms or concepts which comprise a theoretical “starting\\npoint,” on the basis of their meaning being completely definite\\nand clear. For example, the concept of “the application of a\\nconcept to another concept” is a primitive term, along with\\n“force”. (Wang 1996, 9.1.29).  \\nHe spoke to Wang about the general project in 1972:  \\nPhenomenology is not the only approach. Another approach is to find a\\nlist of the main categories (e.g., causation, substance, action) and\\ntheir interrelations, which, however, are to be arrived at\\nphenomenologically. The task must be done in the right manner. (Wang\\n1996, 5.3.7).  \\nGödel spoke with Sue Toledo between 1972 and 1975 about the\\nproject of finding primitive terms, as well as other aspects of\\nphenomenology. See Toledo 2011. We discuss Gödel’s\\ninvolvement with phenomenology further in the supplementary document .  \\nGödel’s Turn to Phenomenology  \\nThe judgement levied upon Gödel’s rationalism by\\ncontemporary philosophers was a harsh one. (See for example Gödel\\n1995, pp. 303–4). Nevertheless Gödel himself remained\\noptimistic. As he commented to Wang:  \\nIt is not appropriate to say that philosophy as rigorous science is\\nnot realizable in the foreseeable future. Time is not the main factor;\\nit can happen anytime when the right idea appears. (Wang 1996,\\n4.3.14).  \\nGödel concluded his 1944 on a similarly optimistic note.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Kurt Gödel'}, page_content='Gödel’s realist views were formulated mostly in the context\\nof the foundations of mathematics and set theory.  \\nWe referred above the list “What I believe,” thought to\\nhave been written in 1960 or thereabouts. Out of 14 items, only two\\nrefer to realism, remarks 10 and 12:  \\nMaterialism is false.  \\nConcepts have an objective existence.  \\nGödel published his views on realism for the first time in his\\n1944. The following is one of his most quoted passages on the\\nsubject:  \\nClasses and concepts may, however, also be conceived as real objects,\\nnamely classes as “pluralities of things,” or as\\nstructures consisting of a plurality of things and concepts as the\\nproperties and relations of things existing independently of our\\ndefinitions and constructions.  \\nIt seems to me that the assumption of such objects is quite as\\nlegitimate as the assumption of physical bodies and there is quite as\\nmuch reason to believe in their existence. They are in the same sense\\nnecessary to obtain a satisfactory system of mathematics as physical\\nbodies are necessary for a satisfactory theory of our sense\\nperceptions and in both cases it is impossible to interpret the\\npropositions one wants to assert about these entities as propositions\\nabout the “data,” i.e., in the latter case the actually\\noccurring sense perceptions.  \\nGödel’s reference to the impossibility of interpreting\\nempirical laws, or more precisely, instantiations of them—the\\nstatements “one wants to assert,”—as statements\\nabout sense perceptions, is likely an endorsement of the (then)\\ncontemporary critique of phenomenalism. The critique was based on the\\nobservation that sense data are so inextricably bound up with the\\nconditions under which they are experienced, that no correspondence\\nbetween statements about those and the statements “we want to\\nassert” can be given (see Chisholm 1948 for example). More\\ngenerally Gödel was against verificationism, namely the idea that\\nthe meaning of a statement is its mode of verification.  \\nThe analogical point in the first part of the passage was amplified by\\nGödel in the draft manuscript “Is Mathematics a Syntax of\\nLanguage?”:  \\nIt is arbitrary to consider “This is red” an immediate\\ndatum, but not so to consider the proposition expressing modus ponens\\nor complete induction (or perhaps some simpler propositions from which\\nthe latter follows). (Gödel 1995, p. 359)  \\nSome writers have interpreted Gödel in this and similar passages\\npragmatically, attributing to him the view that because empirical\\nstatements are paradigmatic of successful reference, reference in the\\ncase of abstract concepts should be modelled causally. (See Maddy\\n1990.) Interpreting reference to objects this way,\\nit is argued, addresses the main difficulty associated with realism,\\nthe problem how we can come to have knowledge of abstract objects.\\nOthers have argued that Gödel had no paradigm case in mind; that\\nfor him both the empirical and the abstract case are either equally\\nproblematic, or equally unproblematic. (See Tait 1986.) The latter\\nview is referred to as epistemological parity in van Atten and Kennedy\\n2003. (See also Kennedy and van Atten 2004.)  \\nabstract  \\nIn his 1947 “What is Cantor’s Continuum Problem?”,\\nGödel expounds the view that in the case of meaningful\\npropositions of mathematics, there is always a fact of the matter to\\nbe decided in a yes or no fashion. This is a direct consequence of\\nrealism, for if there exists a domain of mathematical objects or\\nconcepts, then any meaningful proposition concerning them must be\\neither true or\\n false. The Continuum Hypothesis is Gödel’s example of a\\nmeaningful question. The concept “how many” leads\\n“unambiguously” to a definite meaning of the hypothesis,\\nand therefore it should be decidable—at least in principle. Most\\nstrikingly Gödel does not leave the matter there but goes on to\\noffer a practical strategy for determining the value of the continuum,\\nas well as the truth value of other axioms extending .\\nSpecifically, he offers two criteria for their decidability: the first\\ninvolves conceptual analysis and is associated with Gödel’s\\nrationalistic program. (See the above section on Gödel’s\\nrationalism.) Secondly one must keep an eye on the so-called success\\nof the axiom, as a check or indicator of which direction to look to\\nfor the solution of its truth. For example, Gödel notes in the\\npaper that none of the consequences of the Axiom of Constructibility\\nare very plausible. It is, then, likely false. See Maddy 2011 and\\nKoellner 2014 for discussion of intrinsic vs extrinsic justifications\\nfor new axioms of set theory.  \\n[ ]  \\n23  \\nZFC  \\nFor further discussion of Gödel’s philosophical views see\\nthe supplementary documents:  \\nGödel’s Turn to Phenomenology  \\nand  \\nA Philosophical Argument About the Content of Mathematics  \\npdf include <div class=\"pagebreak\"></div> pdf include'),\n",
