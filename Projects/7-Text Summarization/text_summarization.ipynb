It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas.

That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

      "\n",
      "In his farewell speech after completing five years as President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expressed gratitude to the people of India and shared 10 key messages he learned during his tenure. These messages included accelerating development, empowering villages, promoting agricultural growth, overcoming problems through partnership, and promoting a youth movement for a developed India by 2020. He highlighted the importance of the youth's aspirations and shared a memorable question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020, inspiring him to work towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, found it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be brought to the nation's highest institution and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and fulfilling the aspirations of India's 540 million youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud India. The speaker shares their experience of visiting a village in Nagaland, where they saw the positive impact of an empowered village council. They also highlight the Periyar Maniammai College's initiative to provide urban amenities in rural areas, which has led to employment generation and entrepreneurship. The speaker stresses the need to connect villages with quality roads and provide physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity to transform India's 600,000 villages and make them competitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a concise summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker describes a rural development project, Periyar PURA, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs with the help of self-help groups. The project has developed waste land into cultivable land, promoting sustainable economic development through activities like cultivation, power generation, and food processing. Additionally, the project has collaborated with Japanese experts to develop 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative abilities of the local people. The speaker believes that similar projects, known as PURA, are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with a goal of establishing 7000 such projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares their enriching experience of meeting over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan. They discuss the importance of doubling agricultural production with limited resources and empowering farmers to drive the nation's economic growth. The speaker also shares a inspiring story of meeting a disabled person, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who despite being born without hands and legs, remains hopeful and confident. The overall message is one of resilience and determination to \"defeat problems and succeed\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two inspiring stories. The first is about a physically challenged person who, despite his limitations, blossomed as a talented musician with a positive attitude and perseverance. He was able to perform at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre in 2007. The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who showed indomitable spirit and courage in recovering from the devastating 2005 earthquake. The speech emphasizes the importance of a positive attitude, perseverance, and partnership in overcoming challenges and achieving success.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker reflects on their experiences witnessing courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters. They recall visiting villages affected by earthquakes and tsunamis, where they saw citizens, including children, bravely participating in relief efforts and rebuilding their communities. The speaker was particularly moved by the selflessness of the Car-Nicobar islanders, who took in orphaned children after the 2004 tsunami, and composed a poem, \"Sea Waves,\" to honor their courage. The speech highlights the importance of human resilience and community in the face of adversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a concise summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the Pan African e-Network, a $100 million project to connect 53 African countries via satellite, fiber optics, and wireless networks. The project will link 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 tele-medicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers. A pilot project has already started in Ethiopia, with Indian universities and hospitals providing tele-education and tele-medicine services to African countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses three main topics: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **India-Africa collaboration**: India is providing tele-consultation services to African hospitals and connecting 53 African countries through the Pan African network, showcasing India's technological expertise in bringing societal transformation to the African continent.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Defending the nation**: The speaker expresses pride in India's defense forces, having experienced their work firsthand in challenging environments, such as the Siachen Glacier and on a submarine and fighter jet. The speaker acknowledges the sacrifices and dedication of India's defense personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Youth movement for Developed India 2020**: The speaker mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming Indian youth into enlightened citizens, as part of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, aiming to contribute to India's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the transformation of Indian youth into enlightened citizens through value-based education and leadership. The Lead India 2020 Foundation, in partnership with district administrations, is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, resulting in positive changes such as self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker is optimistic about the country's future, citing the potential of its 540 million youth below the age of 25, and emphasizes the need to empower them through mission-oriented programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's cultural heritage and natural resources while pursuing economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020, driven by the power of its 540 million youth. The speech concludes with a call to action, resolving to work towards a developed India with a distinctive profile that includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "* Equitable distribution of energy and water\n",
      "* Harmonious collaboration between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "* Access to education with a value system for all meritorious candidates\n",
      "* Attracting top talent from around the world\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker encourages citizens to strive for greatness, empowered by the spirit of giving back to the nation, and believes that with determination, India's youth can achieve their goals and make the country a developed nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech envisions a nation with: \n",
      "\n",
      "- Universal access to quality healthcare\n",
      "- Corruption-free and transparent governance\n",
      "- Eradication of poverty, illiteracy, and crimes against vulnerable groups\n",
      "- A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy society with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam concludes by thanking citizens for their support and cooperation over the last five years. He shares his mission to unite the hearts and minds of India's multicultural society, instill self-confidence, and work together to make India a developed nation by 2020.\n",
